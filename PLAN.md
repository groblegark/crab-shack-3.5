# CRAB SHACK — project state & roadmap

Three games, all live on GitHub Pages, all built on the snescat toy PPU
(character-map sprites, 5x7 + 3x5 fonts, 256x240 canvas, no build step).

## STATE OF PLAY — start here (rewritten 2026-08-20, after a second day)

**Suite 230 scenarios, green. Baseline 0/16 (median eviction day 12).
Growth `--buy chef,table` 2/16 — the difference from 3/16 is one town, i.e.
noise; see the note below on why this number moves and why it is not a dial.**

**GROWTH IS 3/16, AND THE DIFFICULTY IS NOT A TARGET TO HIT** — ruled by Matt,
2026-08-20 at 1/16: *"1/16 is ok, we'll do better than the tests, as players."*

**It moved from 1/16 to 3/16 the same day, and NOT by tuning.** The beach ball
turned out to be drawn behind the crab shack — invisible since it landed — and
fixing that meant moving `BALL_X` off the building and onto sand. That changes
the DETOUR every crab pays to reach a game, which changes boredom relief, which
changes walk-outs, which changes staffing. A rendering bug had been holding the
economy fractionally tighter than anyone intended.

Recorded rather than corrected, because the rule below still governs: the
matrix is a regression detector, not a difficulty dial. **Nothing was tuned in
either direction** — 1/16 was where four features left it and 3/16 is where a
bug fix left it, and both are the floor a bot reaches, not a ceiling a player
does.

The documented pillar used to be 2–3 escapes per 8-seed block. It is now 1/16,
and the drop was real: four changes in one day, each costing about one escape —
the empty opening day (−2), polling day (−1), accommodation (inside the noise).
Each was measured at 8 seeds where one town is a coin flip, so each passed
honestly and the erosion only showed up when they were added together. **That
trap is still worth knowing about** (see the note below), but the number itself
is now the target rather than a regression.

**AND THE REASON THE NUMBER IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.** `tools/headless.mjs`
does not play well. It buys a fixed list in a fixed order and then trades on
autopilot: it never re-prices against a rival, never moves an hours sign to get
its crew to a ballot box, never fires a bad hire, never reads the departure
card and works out that half of every purse went home unspent. **The growth
matrix measures the FLOOR — what a town does when nobody is steering it.** A
player who is actually paying attention is not that agent, and should beat it.
So 1/16 is a statement about the naive line, not about whether the game is
winnable.

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR FUTURE WORK:** the matrix stays exactly as valuable as it
was — it is a REGRESSION detector, and a change that takes it to 0/16 has
removed the floor and must be justified. What it is not is a difficulty dial to
tune toward. Do not "fix" the growth number by making the game easier for a bot
that is not trying.

**THE TRAP, kept because it will happen again:** a pillar can be eroded
entirely by changes that are each individually defensible. Every pass measured
its own change against the documented baseline, saw a coin flip, and passed it
in good faith. The check was per-change; the damage was cumulative. **Measure
against the tree you are landing on, not against the number in this file.**

**LANDED 2026-08-19/20**, in merge order:
1. **The visitor pass** — tourists are a POPULATION, not a spawn timer: four
   ferry sailings a day, finite purses minted on arrival and destroyed on
   departure, multi-day stays, and the DRIFTWOOD HOTEL (rooms held as
   `stalls`). The unspent half of every purse is the growth incentive.
2. **The sleeping guest** — `inRoom` had no branch in `updateVisitor`, so an
   overnighter bounced state every frame all night; half of every paid night
   was billed as a night on the promenade.
3. **BRASS** — a rival hotelier who buys the Driftwood out from under REEF and
   competes on board price and wages for the same visitor money.
4. **The town hall** — the shelter's rent and its pot, funded from one of four
   purses the elected mayor picks. Nothing is conjured; conservation is proved
   per movement. The player can stand and win.
5. **The nav strip** — the whole 2512px town to scale in the seven free rows
   above the panel, SHACK named and flashing when the till takes money, MANAGE
   and TOWN chips lifting both screens out from behind building-clicks.
6. **The queue pass** — a place in line is stamped when you JOIN, the shuffle
   steps both ways, locals aim at the back. 132k pairs: zero inversions.
7. **Mine**: the beach ball, the ferry canon (ONE
   boat), a save/load crash that bricked any town saved mid-errand, the
   sick-day errand-window fix, and two automated UI sweeps. (A PAUSE landed
   here too and was **removed again on 2026-08-20** by owner ruling — see
   THERE IS NO PAUSE below before you consider rebuilding it.)

**LANDED 2026-08-20:**
8. **POLLING DAY** — the election stopped being a function call. Two tables you
   walk to, polls that shut at 19:00, paper ballots bought off the ferry, and a
   hand count that is the only thing that knows the answer. Turnout 82% with a
   real gradient by shift and trade. See the POLLING DAY section below.
9. **The empty opening** — a new town opens deserted at 07:00 and the 08:00
   sailing lands the first tourists you ever see. The free first night was
   probed and DECLINED with the number: the empty start costs $34 and a rent
   grace hands back $230.

10. **THE ILLNESS ROLL — MEASURED AND DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED.** This was in
    the queue below with a diagnosis and a recommended fix, both written by
    me, and **both were wrong**. The full write-up is at the end of this file;
    the short version, because it is the most useful thing anybody learned
    today:
    - The sampling bias is REAL and large — the roll judges a morning crab
      carrying 1.7x the hunger and 1.8x the thirst of an evening crab, because
      the settlement runs before an evening crab has clocked off.
    - **The outcome does not move.** The evening crab carries 1.2x the
      exhaustion into the same roll, the halves cancel, and assembled risk
      comes out M/E **x0.98** over 2124 crew crab-nights. The 9.2%-vs-1.9%
      figure I put in this file **does not reproduce in any rig.**
    - Swap the founders' shifts and the gap follows **the crab, not the
      shift** — PINCHY is the sicker of the two on mornings AND on evenings.
      CLAWDIA is `TIDY`, a founder trait in crabs.js. That is the supercrab.
    - Both obvious fixes were built and rejected on measurement. "Judge their
      own day" — the one recommended here — is **worse on exactly the thing it
      was for**: +116% town risk, because a morning crab clocks off at 14:00
      and stays up while an evening crab clocks off at 20:00 and goes to bed.
      A morning crab really does spend 2.48h a night past the exhaustion line
      against an evening crab's 1.41h. **That is a real day, not an artifact.**
    - What shipped is the rig (`tools/shiftill.mjs`), an inert `rollLog` seam,
      `illRisk()` split out with the receipt, three scenarios and two charts.
      Behaviour is byte-identical.

    **The lesson, and it is the same one as the merge failures:** a
    measurement in this file is not a fact until somebody has reproduced it.
    I wrote 9.2/1.9 into STATE OF PLAY as settled and recommended a fix off
    it; an agent asked to reproduce it first found it was noise at ~180
    crab-nights an arm. Ask for the reproduction BEFORE the fix, every time.

**NEXT UP — THE BRIEF IS NOW CULTURAL COMPLETENESS** (Matt, 2026-08-20): CS3
has to be *"a really complete crab island culture"*, and **the crab people are
a REPRESENTATIVE CRABOCRACY**. See THE CULTURE OF THE CRAB PEOPLE below — it
carries the canon, including the mainland pigs, and what it does to the
backlog. CS4 ("build your own cultureway") is pushed back.

Open, in order:
- **The lease card's wall of text** — the last item from Ben's playtest, and
  the first screen a new player sees. It wants a hook, not more words.
- **Deepening the crabocracy** — the office, the ballot and the count are the
  town's central institution now, not a side system.
- ~~A surf spot mid-beach~~ — **HELD** by Matt: "not quite yet, but we will do
  it." Do not build it; do not drop it.
- ~~Owner-initiated FOR SALE~~ — **SETTLED**: the player answers an offer, they
  do not invite one. "Let's keep (3) the same for now."
- ~~**The departure card**~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-08-20**: the day report's second
  page, naming every visitor who sailed on today's boats, with a quote DERIVED
  from a per-visit stay ledger — never random. See "THE DEPARTURE CARD" at the
  foot of this file.
- ~~**The onboarding/UI pass**~~ — **MOSTLY SHIPPED 2026-08-20** (see THE
  ONBOARDING PASS below): shop tooltips, a five-page HELP card with three
  front doors, a hire you can actually see arrive, TODAY +$N in place of the
  $/S readout, a TILL TODAY board on your own shopfront, and the tips-slider
  mush plus the class behind it. **Still open from Ben's list: the wall-of-
  text opening** — the lease card is the first screen and it explains terms
  to somebody who does not yet care. It wants a hook, not more words.
- **A surf spot mid-beach** — explicitly deferred by Matt behind the ball.

**THE THREE RULINGS THAT CONSTRAIN NEW WORK** (each has its own section
below): resources are never conjured; the town's name is embargoed until the
ending; and interface opacity is a bug while economic uncertainty is the game.

**THE LESSON OF THE NIGHT, for whoever picks this up:** nearly every merge
failure was **a test asserting a coincidence rather than a mechanism** — a
house within 500px rather than the nearest free door; one specific funded
fisher rather than whoever had the savings; one sampled voter rather than the
roster; a two-arm price comparison inside a town where three other things were
moving. Each held only while the town stayed small and predictable, and each
broke the moment the town got richer. When a scenario fails after a merge, ask
FIRST whether it was testing the rule or the coincidence. And when you relax
one, mutation-test it: the rivalry counter-arm is only trustworthy because
removing `priceAppeal` from the visitor's choice still makes it fail.

## CS3: what it is

A simulation-style beach-town economy. Design call (Matt): **simulation, not
arcade** — other actors have the same abilities the player does.

**The loop**: fishers land the catch off the pier → your kitchen buys it →
crabs cook → servers carry plates to *seated* guests → wages go out nightly →
crabs spend their own wallets on meals, showers, arcade → reputation
compounds or collapses → the landlord collects at 20:00 either way.

### Systems (all in game.js unless noted)
- **Businesses** (`BIZ` table, data-driven): CRAB SHACK (player), THE
  CLAWCADE ($650), JUICE BAR ($400, player — shipped with T2 in the old
  laundromat's lot AND shop slot), SUDS SHOWERS (NPC-owned by SUDSY),
  DRIFTWOOD HOTEL (NPC-owned by REEF, seven rooms, buyable off its own
  shopfront — see the visitor entry). (SUDS N BUBBLES, the $400 laundromat,
  was removed 2026-08-18 — see the shipped note below.) Each: stations,
  recipes, queue, rent, owner.
- **VISITORS, and the ferry that brings them** (2026-08-19): tourist demand is
  a POPULATION, not a timer. Named visitors land in ferry batches (four
  sailings a day, batch size off reputation), walk down the pier into town,
  carry a wallet of real money and the same five needs a crab carries, sleep
  at the hotel or on the sand, and go home a day or two later on a later boat.
  A visitor is a persistent `customers` entry (`k.visitor`), so the queue,
  seating, tipping, busing, follow-cam and dossier all work on them unchanged.
  `window.onFerry(kind)` is the seam for the horizon/mainland work.
- **THE TOWN HALL** (2026-08-19): a **TOWN FUND** (`townFund`) with an audited
  ledger, a **MAYOR** in a top hat (`hall.mayor`, `crabHat`), and an
  **ELECTION** every Sunday. The office's whole remit is the homeless shelter -
  its RENT (to Mr. Pincherton) and its POT of bowls, bought from the shack the
  night before. What the mayor decides is WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM: one of
  four `PURSES` (levy on takings / harbour dues per head landed / a cut of Mr.
  Pincherton's house rents / a collection tin) at a rate the office sets.
  Money enters the fund only through `fundTake` (out of a named payer's live
  balance), and leaves only through `fundPay` (into a shop's till, as a sale)
  or `fundRemit` (destroyed at the landlord, like every other rent). Crabs vote
  their own circumstances (`potStake` / `purseCost` / `platBowls`), one written
  line per voter, and **the player can stand and win**. Fund dry -> the pot is
  COLD; three missed rents -> the shelter is BOLTED and its crabs `sleepRough`.
  See the shipped entry below.
- **Owner layer**: `OWNERS` registry + `creditBiz`/`debitBiz`/`ownerFunds`.
  The player's till IS `coins`. NPC revenue never touches player books.
  The registry GROWS: `BIZ[k].owner` is a key into it, `null` means nobody
  owns the lot (closed, on the market), and a crab who buys a business gets a
  new entry. Owner changes, one owner with several businesses (one till,
  strikes counted per lease) and an owner with none all fall out of that.
- **Business failure, FOR SALE and succession** (`SALE_CFG` + the
  `business failure & succession` block in game.js): a peer owner who misses
  three settlements in a row CLOSES - shutters and a priced FOR SALE sign in
  the world, no tourists, no errands, staff and owner-operator laid off to the
  pier. Any crab with the savings buys it (the player through the shopfront's
  BUY chip); a new NPC owner runs the same policy tables, because those tables
  key on the BUSINESS. See the feature entry below for the numbers.
- **THE RIVALRY** (`RIVAL_CFG` + the `THE RIVALRY` block in game.js,
  2026-08-19): a peer owner comes for a business that is doing FINE. It keys on
  the LEASE NEXT DOOR (`rivalOwnerId()` = whoever holds SUDS SHOWERS), not on
  SUDSY, because her shop fails in most long runs and a fisher buys it - the
  new holder inherits the ambition, exactly the way the policy tables key on
  the business. What she can RAISE (a war chest, her till, her pocket, her
  credit line) over what the bar is WORTH (the succession pricer plus a
  going-concern premium, smoothed) is the intent, and it walks EYEING -> OFFER
  -> COMPETE with a warning at every step. See the feature entry below.
- **THE HOTELIER** (`HOTELIER_CFG` + the `THE HOTELIER` block in game.js,
  2026-08-19): **BRASS**, a new crab, gets off the morning bus around day 7-12
  with $800 and buys the DRIFTWOOD HOTEL off REEF through the player's own
  OFFER chip, then runs it for money. REEF was written as a soft touch ("no
  heir, and a fair price will always tempt him"), which made the hotel a shop
  the player BUYS rather than a rival; `soft` now sits on the OWNER row rather
  than the lease, so the crab who buys him out does NOT inherit his fair price.
  Two levers, both settings the player also holds, one move every two nights,
  every one of them named in the day report: the ROOM RATE moves with the beds
  she sold (`today.roomsLet`), and the WAGE goes over the best rate in town
  when a guest sleeps on the sand with a bed standing unmade. She competes for
  the VISITOR'S PURSE (a dearer room is held back before anything else is
  bought) and for LABOUR (`townWage()` is a mean, so her raise moves the
  player's crew's `payRatio`). A missed lease payment makes her walk the last
  move back in public. See the feature entry below.
- **THE PRICE IS A SETTING** (`BIZ[k].priceMul` / `menuPrice` / `localPrice`,
  2026-08-19): the last frozen business number. 0.70-1.30 in 5% steps, a
  stepper on the management screen, and tourists read boards - `bizPull(b)` is
  the shop's base weight times `priceAppeal`. The spawn INTERVAL is computed
  from the UNPRICED weights, so the promenade is ZERO SUM: undercutting takes
  trade off the shop next door and never conjures guests out of the sea.
  Default 1 is bit-identical to the frozen build.
- **Crabs**: personas (name, trait, commute mode, accessory, shift, wallet,
  house), needs FED/THIRST/CLN/FUN/SPA, homes they live inside, the shelter for the
  homeless, disease + contagion + death with beach memorials. **Every crab is
  mortal** (2026-08-19) - crew and townsfolk alike, off the same care ladder;
  the roll arms on day 4 of NEGLECT, day 7 of anything better.
- **Needs that fail in their own character** (2026-08-19): boredom **DRIFTS**
  and tiredness **STALLS**, instead of both quietly shaving crabEff. A bored
  crab on shift leaves its post for the tide line or the arcade window and has
  to walk back when an order lands; past 0.95 for four settlements it takes an
  unauthorised, unpaid day nobody covers. An exhausted crab nods off mid-task
  while HOLDING the station slot, and past 0.97 may not make it home at all -
  and sleeping rough banks no repair, so exhaustion prevents its own cure.
  Boredom's only two cures are the ARCADE (money) and a CONVERSATION (time);
  there is no free-fun venue and no solo cure, by the owner's ruling. Landing
  with it: **sleep got expensive** - a shift costs 0.60, tiredness accrues
  THROUGH the shift rather than in a lump at knock-off, and the shelter cot
  barely rests you (one night from 0.80 leaves 0.06 in your own bed, 0.33 on a
  cot, 0.80 on the sand). The housing ladder now decides who nods off at the
  grill. See the feature entry below for every number and the attribution table.
- **Public taps** (`WATER_TAPS`, 2026-08-19): two free standpipes, promenade
  (x640) and pier head (x1844). No queue, no staff, no till, no hours - the
  floor under every crab's thirst, plus a cold rinse for a crab the showers
  cannot serve. Pitched ABOVE the drink errand's threshold so the juice bar
  keeps first refusal (see the public-taps entry for the numbers).
- **Facilities pattern**: guests occupy things. Shower stalls — attendant
  hands out a kit, guest showers, stall goes dirty, staff cleans it. Dining —
  guests are seated when their order is claimed, server carries the plate to
  the table, and since 2026-08-19 **staff bus the table too** — a vacated
  table goes DIRTY with the plates on it and seats nobody until a crab clears
  it, off the same dirty/cleaning cycle the stalls use. (The old outdoor rule,
  guests bussing their own, survives only as the `_selfBused` paired-arm probe.)
- **Tips are the table's** (2026-08-19): a plate handed over the counter tips
  a token `TIP_COUNTER` 0.15 of the full tip; a seated guest tips the lot AND
  leaves a $9 table tip on the way out. `BIZ[k].tipShare` splits any tip
  between the till and the crab who served it (slider on the SCHEDULE tab).
- **Fishing**: the town's default profession. SALTY + DRIFT cast off the pier,
  earn subsistence pay, spend it in town. `townCatch` stocks the shack:
  fish $4 fresh / $7 imported; catch mostly spoils overnight.
- **Shop**: concrete equipment only — HIRE CRAB, GRILL+, BOARD+, TABLE+, plus
  business unlocks and their gear upgrades. You start with ONE grill, ONE
  board, TWO tables (four more are buyable since 2026-08-19: TABLE+ max 4).
  No abstract multipliers (deleted: knife/flame/shoes/ads/
  expand).
- **Reputation** replaces ads: table service and happy guests build word of
  mouth, rage-quits cost triple, nightly regression to the mean; foot traffic
  scales with rep. Chip in the world's top-right corner.
- **2D movement**: crabs have x/y, soft-body collision, solid stations/tables/
  stalls, lane routing (`routedStep`), head-on passing, y-sorted painter.
- **Housing market (everyone)**: 9 lots — the promenade row (0–5), one by the
  shelter (6), two beach cottages past the pier (7–8). NPCs have no private
  nooks any more: everyone homeless sleeps on shelter cots, pays $10 house
  rent when housed, and moves up at settlement when wallet ≥ move-in ($35) +
  rent. Fishers fund it at $2/catch; SUDSY pays herself a bigger owner draw
  while homeless. World is 2192 wide. **All 9 lots stand permanently**
  (2026-08-18): drawTown walks the lots and asks `houseOccupant(h)` — an
  occupied house wears its tenant's roof color, a vacant one renders as
  HOUSE_EMPTY (weathered grey roof, dark glass, TO LET card, bare interior).
  Night window glow keys on an occupant at home (crew AND townsfolk; boat
  dwellers keep the cabin lamp), so empty lots stay dark. Houses never pop
  into existence — people move into a town that was already there.
- **Hiring is recruitment** (2026-08-18, the directive): the SHOP hire no
  longer mints a persona with a free house. `hireCrew()` recruits — a
  CURRENTLY-VISITING tourist by preference (their customer entity converts
  into a resident crew crab keeping the tourist name/color/accessory, with
  abortErrand-grade cleanup: stall freed+dirtied, table freed+plate cleared,
  mid-claim chefs abortChef'd, entity dropped from the queue, follow/dossier
  transferred), else a new face answers the ad off the morning bus at the
  west stop. Either way the hire completes immediately (`hireShift()` picks
  a shift that can still work today) and starts HOMELESS at the shelter —
  no free house, they climb the ladder on wages. Names dedupe across
  CRAB_NAMES + CUSTOMER_NAMES (a converted tourist keeps their name if
  free); spawnDrifter shares the dedupe. headless `--set chef` calls
  hireCrew() too — no housed-hire fork in tools/.
- **Job board / labor market**: a notice board at x716 (clickable — postings +
  town payrolls). Each morning at 7:30 (`runJobBoard`) NPC owners post when
  flush (till ≥ 260, staff < 2) or when their shop went dark; jobless fishers
  take postings ($20/day, `p.employer`); a posting unfilled for a full day
  pulls a drifter off the morning bus (cap 8 npcs, they start homeless with a
  fishSpot fallback). Owners pay staff from their till at settlement or the
  staff quit back to the pier. Crew reassignment now lives in the dossier
  ("TAP: REASSIGN" on the DOES row) plus a labeled JOB> chip on the follow
  card — the old 13px unlabeled chip was the "can't assign staff" bug.
- **Labor policy** (`SICK_POLS` / `CARE_LANES` / `OT_*` / `LABOR_CFG` in
  game.js): per-business sick-day policy + per-crab override, a graded
  convalescence ladder where resting in your own bed genuinely cures faster,
  a 1.5x overtime premium bounded by the shop's open hours, and an
  auto-manage rule table that peer owners run by default and the player can
  delegate to. Surfaced on the management screen's SCHEDULE tab, the TOWN
  census, and the dossier's SHIFT/HEALTH rows.
- **The wage** (`WAGE_STD` / `BIZ[b].wage` / `p.wage` / `WAGE_CFG` /
  `WAGE_POLICY` in game.js, 2026-08-19): pay is DATA, per business and per
  crab, set on the SCHEDULE tab beside the roster. Underpaid crabs grumble,
  warn, then quit (NPC) or walk out (crew); well-paid crabs cannot be poached
  and climb the housing ladder faster; peer owners run a convergent wage policy
  of their own. `NPC_WAGE` is retired — see the feature entry for the model,
  the sweep and the verdict on whether the lever is real.
- **Sick crabs can move**: bed rest no longer bars essential errands — the
  sick still buy food and drag themselves to the showers (half
  speed), which feeds the `cared` check that improves cure and death odds.
  Arcade nights stay off-limits. This closed the calibration-flagged spiral
  where the sick couldn't re-clean.
- **The far shore + the evening mist** (`drawHorizon`/`drawMist`/
  `drawHorizonTraffic`, 2026-08-19): another coast across the water — two
  quantised ridges, a lighthouse on the point, a town whose windows come on
  after dark — on a 0.04 parallax above the sea band, plus a per-day mist
  (`mistPeak(day)`, an integer hash, no RNG, nothing saved) that rolls in
  through the late afternoon and takes it away most evenings. **Nothing in the
  game ever says the town is on an island**; the horizon says it. Imports the
  trade ledger counts arrive on a freighter out there; the ferry crosses it on
  Thursdays without calling. PURE DRAW - suite-proved byte-identical.
- **THE FERRY, the win condition** (`FERRY_PRICE` **20000**, the office at
  x1806 and the fingerpost at x1148, 2026-08-19): buy the boat and you WIN -
  a third ending beside EVICTED and BANKRUPT (`won` is a flavour of
  `gameOver`), snapshotted into `winRec` and saved. Price measured, not felt:
  a strong `--buy chef,table` town crosses it around day 105-130 and no
  documented run comes within 5x. See the feature entry.
- **CYCLE THE FOCUS** (`cyclerRects` / `cycleSel`, 2026-08-19): two chevrons
  **in the character card's own header** that step the SELECTION through the
  town's roster and take the CAMERA with them (crew first, then townsfolk;
  tourists deliberately out; wraps both ways; `[` / `]` too). It shipped as a
  48x17 `< crab >` chip under the sun and Matt cut it the same day — *"the new
  character selector thing takes up too much room: make it just little buttons
  on the character info window"* — so it now costs the HUD nothing and lives
  on the thing it steps. Two consequences, both deliberate: **no card, no
  chevrons** (you click a crab first, then flick — `cyclerLive()` keeps the
  keys working with nothing selected), and a **tourist's card gets them too**,
  since tourists are outside the cycle and the chevrons are the way back into
  the roster. Hides behind any full-screen card. The card grew 52 -> 58px in
  the same pass so `MORE>` stops landing on top of the ZZZ need bar.
- **UI**: title → lease-signing intro (Mr. Pincherton) → play. CREW / SHOP /
  MENU tabs, a three-tab management card (HOURS / SCHEDULE / TOWN census),
  BILL chip (itemized nightly bill), follow-cam on ANY crab
  including NPCs, fast-forward >>/>>>/>>>> = 2/3/6x (F), master mute (M).
- **Right-click orders** (crew only): with a crew crab followed, right-click
  redirects them — open ground = walk there (breaks cleanly from any activity
  via abortActivity, resumes schedule after a ~2.5s linger), their workplace =
  clock in now, their home/shelter = knock off for ~2 game-hours (restDay/
  restUntil), another business = run that errand immediately (forcedErrand
  reuses pickErrand's pricing/staffing gates, queue cap enforced on arrival).
  Every refusal pops ("PINCHY: CAN'T RIGHT NOW") — never silent. Townsfolk
  refuse ("I'VE GOT MY OWN LIFE"): crew-only control is a design choice, NPC
  agency stays intact. Desktop right-click only — touch deferred (long-press
  collides with merge mode's hold gesture). No context menu yet ("at some
  point"). Paired **auto-unstick** watchdog for ALL walkers: <2px net progress
  over 1.5s while genuinely underway (stepTo ran, target >8px away — queues/
  stations/bus/pauses never qualify) triggers a perpendicular sidestep
  (±12px y, 6px back-off, 1.0s waypoint), alternating sides up to 4 retries,
  then a give-up quip (a directed crab abandons the order). This is the
  sanctioned fix for the audited still-vs-mover collision pin. Fires ~1-2x/day
  town-wide in headless runs.
- **Crab dossier**: clicking the follow card opens a full-screen record —
  job, shift, wallet, housing, health, need bars, claims to fame. Click or
  Esc closes. Works for every crab, crew and townsfolk alike. **Two pages
  since 2026-08-19** (PROFILE | DIARY) with a bottom control bar carrying
  FOLLOW and CLOSE — see THE CRAB DIARY below.
- **THE CRAB DIARY** (`crabLog` + the DIARY page, 2026-08-19): every crab —
  crew, townsfolk, owner-operators, fishers, drifters — keeps a bounded ring
  buffer of what it DID, in the game's voice, on its persona (so it saves).
  40 entries, oldest dropped, `[day, minute, category, line]`. One call at
  each event site; nothing runs per tick.
- **Save slots + SAVED TOWNS screen** (Matt's directive, shipped 2026-08-18):
  five towns, not one. Keys `crabshack3_v1_s1..s5` plus `crabshack3_v1_active`
  (the autosave target, persisted); the legacy single key `crabshack3_v1`
  migrates into slot 1 byte-for-byte on first boot, then retires. A slot holds
  the SAME envelope save() always wrote — **opaque** to the save layer, so new
  fields from any system ride along — plus two sidecars this layer owns:
  `_ver` (import guard) and `_meta` (day, weekday, coins, rep, pop, a crew
  roster snapshot with name/color/accessory/job/housing tier/sick/OT, and a
  real timestamp). `_meta` is fully derivable from the envelope (`slotMeta`),
  so migrated and imported saves get a preview card for free and `slotCard()`
  falls back to deriving it. UI: a SAVED TOWNS button on the title and a SAVE
  chip in the panel tab row (which REPLACED the old panel NEW chip — new games
  are now per-slot, with a confirm, where they belong) open an overlay with its
  own rect table, sized off H so both canvas modes work: five slot rows, then
  the selected town's crew as 2x portraits with name/job/housing/health, then
  LOAD / NEW HERE / DELETE / EXPORT and a global IMPORT FILE. DELETE and
  NEW-HERE-onto-a-town are two-tap confirms (3.5s arm). EXPORT writes the slot
  JSON via an `a[download]` + Blob URL named `crabshack3-slotN-dayD-stamp.json`;
  IMPORT reads a `.json` through a hidden `<input type="file" id="importSave">`
  in index.html, validates shape + version BEFORE anything is written
  (`saveProblem` — not-JSON, wrong app, no crew, unnamed crew, bad day/coins,
  newer `_ver`; the reason prints on the card), stages it, and only writes on
  confirm. An imported old-build save runs the same load() migrations a stored
  one does. Deleting the slot you're playing reboots into it rather than
  leaving a zombie autosave.

### Verified balance (8 seeds, tools/headless.mjs)
- **THE LONG GAME (2026-08-19, measured for the ferry's price).** The curves
  below are all short-horizon; the win condition needed the other end of them.
  A surviving `--buy chef,table` town banks roughly **$230 a night** once the
  crew is deep and the room is full, near-linearly from about day 40:
  **$5,090 (d41), $11,068 (d71), $20,660 (d111), $31,473 (d160)** on seed
  1337. Over 150 days x 6 seeds it reads **3/6 alive on $22,991 / $23,797 /
  $28,971**. Buying the SIDE BUSINESSES makes a town measurably POORER over
  that horizon — `--buy chef,table,grill,board,juicebar,arcade,cadegear` over
  120 days x 8 reads 4/8 alive on **$3,696-$6,769**, because the arcade and
  juice bar add nightly rent and pull crew off the shack. Grill+/board+ are
  free of that (one-off cost, no rent) and read the same as chef,table alone.
  **FERRY_PRICE 20000 is set against that curve**: ~day 105-130 for a strong
  town, 5.5x above the best till any documented short run ever reaches.
- **The 16-seed baseline at HEAD is 0/16, median 10** (evictions
  9,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,11,12,12,12,12,13, lifetime $49,354), measured
  2026-08-19 on a pristine control tree. The 13-14 quoted in the older entries
  below is stale. Growth `--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` is **4/8**
  (9,10,12,13,41,41,41,41, lifetime $97,299).
- **CURRENT (2026-08-19, after THE EMPTY START — see "THE OPENING: THE TOWN,
  THEN THE BOAT"):** baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16` **0/16, median 11**
  (9,9,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,13,14,16,17, lifetime $55,598); growth
  `--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` **2/8** (10,11,11,11,13,26,41,41) and
  **1/8 on the second block** (`--seedbase 8`: 8,9,9,10,11,12,18,41) — **3/16
  across both blocks, against 5/16 on the same tree before the change**. The
  control was measured on this worktree at `aefd7a0`, not read out of this
  file: **0/16 median 11** (6,9,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,14,15,15) and
  growth **3/8** then **2/8**. Lose-by-default is untouched; growth is one town
  down in each block, which is what a day-one till $34 lighter buys you.
- (superseded by the empty start) **after the ferry/visitor/hotel pass,
  RE-MEASURED ON THE MERGED TREE and identical to the agent's own figures —
  the three merge resolutions below cost the economy nothing:** baseline
  `--days 30 --seeds 16` **0/16, median 11**
  (6,8,9,9,10,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,13,13,14,15); growth
  `--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` **2/8 alive** (6,8,9,10,14,15,41,41)
  and **3/8 on the second seed block** (`--seedbase 8`: 11,11,12,15,17,41x3).
  ACROSS BOTH BLOCKS the growth curve is **6/16 before and 5/16 after** — and
  the pre-pass build itself reads 4/8 then 2/8 on those same two blocks, so
  eight growth seeds is a coin. See the visitor entry for the full before/after
  and the propped demand probe.
- (superseded) after the table-service economy: baseline
  `--days 30 --seeds 16` **0/16, median 13** (10-19); growth
  `--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` **3/8 alive**
  (13,13,13,14,15,41,41,41). The growth drop from 6/8 is the busing labour
  cost, not the new table rungs — `--buy chef` alone reads the same 3/8.
- Baseline (buy nothing): **0/8 survive, median eviction ~11-13** — the
  8-seed snapshot moves a day either way per build; at 16 seeds the tails run
  6–20+. Fully combined tree (credit LIMIT 90 + T2 thirst/juice bar, wage
  23, 2026-08-18): 0/8, evictions 12-22, median 14. Credit LIMIT was
  tightened 120→90 at the T2 merge; the later +1 (13→14, tails to 21-22)
  came from town-wide auto-unstick — crabs genuinely work more hours now,
  and LIMIT 70 measured no better, so the QoL win stands undiluted. If
  Matt wants the knife-edge back, spawn pacing or rent are the honest
  levers, chosen deliberately.
  Standing pressures: job-board labor competition (a hired-away fisher lowers
  townCatch, pushing the shack onto $7 import fish; SUDSY's flush-hire
  threshold till ≥ 260 spares the earliest days) and the needs-drag rework
  (hungry/dirty crews work up to ~24% slower). T2 adds the thirst cycle:
  crews sustain retail drinking off the raised wage; wallet-starved NPC
  fishers ride parched near the +0.12/night sickness line — the intended
  new pressure.
- Hire-and-seat strategy (`--buy chef,table`): escape is seed-lucky —
  roughly 0-2 of 6 seeds at day 40 depending on build. The suite's growth
  gate (1 of 4 seeds escapes, or median eviction > 18) is the guard that
  counts.
- Constants: shack rent 230, wage 23 (**now the DEFAULT rate, not a constant —
  see "THE WAGE IS A SETTING"**; raised from 22 with T2 — crews drink
  at retail, the wage keeps their wallets liquid, bands 8-32), house rent
  10, hires 60×2.0,
  showers 5/10, fish pay 13. **Rent is charged from night one** — you open
  with $150 in your pocket and have to trade your way to the first payment.
  **Re-opened and re-closed 2026-08-19** when the empty start landed: a
  rent-free first night reads 0/16 but **median eviction 16** (evictions 11-24)
  against the documented 11-13, so it stays deleted. See "THE OPENING: THE
  TOWN, THEN THE BOAT".
- **Queue**: 5 slots, of which tourists may fill 4 — the 5th is reserved for
  locals (crew + neighbours). WHERE those five stand is its own thing since
  2026-08-20 — see STANDING IN LINE: a place is stamped when you JOIN a line
  (`qSeq`), not by where you sit in `customers`, and the shuffle steps both
  ways. The counts here are untouched by that pass.
  Still the binding constraint on the whole
  economy: with the ferry model a visitor leaves town with about HALF their
  purse unspent, and the commonest reason they are offered nothing is that the
  line already holds its four. That is the growth incentive, made of money. Staff claim paying guests first and serve locals
  in the lulls — and a local past HALF patience jumps the line (T2: the juice
  bar's additive tourist stream never lulls on its own; without the jump,
  locals starved in its queue and raged out parched).
- History worth knowing: an earlier build measured 7/8 escape, but that number
  was inflated by a bug — at saturated reputation tourists filled every slot
  and locals never got served (free revenue, no service cost, and a quiet
  sickness spiral). Fixing it made growth genuinely harder. If escape needs to
  come up, prefer capacity/throughput levers over re-hiding the locals.
- Causal notes from calibration: rep saturates for every town so *capacity*
  (chef count) binds; crew deaths were the escape-killer (sick crabs can't
  re-clean, so cheap showers matter); buy *timing* beat buy prices.

## Tools (the load-bearing part)
See also CLAUDE.md: the sim contract (simlib runs the REAL game files in a
vm — never fork game logic into tools/) and perf expectations live there.
- `node tools/suite.mjs` — **the full suite, and it must stay green before any
  push, with the EXIT CODE CHECKED** (`if node tools/suite.mjs; then …; else
  …; fi` — a `;`-chained command masks the failure and has pushed red twice).
  A scenario COUNT goes stale within the day and this file has carried five
  wrong ones at once; ask the runner, not the doc.
- `node tools/illness.mjs [--seeds N] [--days D] [--quiet]` — illness-duration
  distributions per housing tier. Paired arms per seed: the care ladder live
  vs collapsed back onto the pre-seam CARED odds *inside the same build*, plus
  a RUNG arm (a housed crab rolled at cot odds) that isolates the housing rung
  on an identical RNG stream. This is where the cared-seam numbers in the
  labor-policy bullet come from.

- `--nohotelier` on `tools/headless.mjs` keeps REEF behind the Driftwood's desk
  (game.js reads `window._noHotelier` through `hotelierOn()` and never sets it),
  which is the paired arm behind every number in the hotelier entry. The seed
  matrix's summary line carries `hotelier N/K` - how many towns she reached -
  plus `roomLets` and `unhoused`.
- `--norival` on `tools/headless.mjs` switches THE RIVALRY off (game.js reads
  `window._noRival` through `rivalOn()` and never sets it), which is how the
  paired arms behind the rivalry numbers were measured.
- `--nohall` does the same for THE TOWN HALL (`window._noHall` via `hallOn()`):
  no fund, no purse, no shelter rent, no pot, no elections. Every balance
  number in the mayor entry has a `--nohall` arm of the SAME build behind it,
  which is a stronger comparison than the pre-feature build - it isolates the
  feature rather than the week.

  Covers balance curves, dishes/dining, errands, staff meals, stuck-crab
  detection (baseline + full town), 6x-dt stability, homeless recovery,
  NPC housing ladder, boat rung + catch boost, sick-crab mobility,
  job-board hire/payroll/quit, stall-wedge soak, T1 trade-ledger flows,
  line-of-credit draw/bankruptcy/predictor-lead/roundtrip,
  disease infection/cure/mortality, showers turnover, NPC economics,
  save/load (incl. boat berths), save SLOTS (legacy-key migration into
  slot 1, two independent towns across a switch, import refusal + staged
  commit + old-build import re-migration, the preview card), no-inflation wallet bounds, needs-drag
  crab routing (chained trip, town walk-distance, warps+unsticks floor,
  travel-lane clearance tripwire),
  save/load (incl. boat berths), no-inflation wallet bounds, needs-drag
  visibility, laundromat-removal migration (one-shot refund) + dirt
  serviced by showers alone, thirst serviced end-to-end at the bar,
  parched-spiral sickness attribution (with a watered control arm),
  juicebar economics (ledger flows charged-vs-tracked, staff retail,
  save/load roundtrip of thirst + unlock + firstPour), tired
  accrual/sleep-repair (bed vs cot rates) and the sandy->tired save
  migration, the needs-failure gates (the trudge's curve + scaling + the
  shimmer's mean-neutrality, the anti-spiral paired arms, the wide berth's
  separation + declined table + sit-anyway out, and a filthy crab wedging
  nobody in a crowded shack).
  serviced by showers alone, days-off rota (weekly rest + off-day
  spending, cover-shift/stagger coverage, exact wage-skip bill math),
  hiring-as-recruitment (tourist conversion with clean entity teardown,
  bus-arrival fallback working day-of, all-9-lots occupancy derivation
  with no house conjured on hire), and shop hours (frozen day-2 default
  fingerprint, shortened hours really close, SUDSY policy convergence +
  extend rule + tiredness budget, sun-skip across an hours change,
  AT COST/FREE staff-meal accounting, hours/mealPol/policy save roundtrip
  with degenerate-save clamping).
  Plus the labor policy suite: sick-day GRANT/REQUIRE, the bed-vs-cot
  recovery shift, OT's exact 1.5x rate + geometry + needs acceleration, the
  OT marker rendering and clearing, auto-manage convergence (one move a day,
  a real cooldown, no thrash over a fortnight), SUDSY running the same
  policy with an OUT SICK placard and no panic posting, census derivation +
  every sort and filter, and the labor-settings save/load roundtrip.
  Plus business failure & succession: the three-strike closure (layoffs, no
  tourists, no errands, no takings), a saved-up crab buying the shop and
  trading again under the new owner's policies, the player's shopfront buy
  path end to end, a 20-day closure soak with nobody able to afford it, and
  the ownership + FOR SALE market save/load roundtrip.

- `node tools/headless.mjs --days N --seeds K [--buy list] [--quiet]
  [--jobs J] [--failoff a,b,c]` — CLI; `--failoff` switches individual
  needs-failure behaviours off (`wander,chat,walkout,nod,rough`) so a matrix can
  attribute its own movement to one of them at a time; `--jobs` fans seeds out across worker processes
  (default cores−1, deterministic either way, ~3x faster on 4 seeds).
  Its buyer models a sensible player: hourly purchase checks, reserve = cost +
  tonight's bill + cushion, saves (doesn't skip) for the big unlocks, rehires
  after a death, and only staffs a side business if the shack keeps shift
  coverage.
- `tools/simlib.mjs` — the sim core: real game files in a vm with stubbed
  browser APIs, seeded RNG, `runUntil`/`runDays`. ~10 sim-days/sec.
- Dev flags: `?fresh` (no save), `?turbo=N`.
- Browser testing: serve on a spare port, use a playwright route handler to
  bypass cache (`await p.route('**/*', r => r.continue())`) — the dev server
  caches game files hard; only index.html gets a `?t=` bust.

## Gameplay features (recent)
- **THE FLICKERING HOTEL** (owner report, 2026-08-19, verbatim: *"some kind of
  crazy flashing happens at night at the hotel, where if I click on a crab the
  character panel and the crab flicker like crazy"*). `updateVisitor()` had a
  branch for every visitor state EXCEPT `inRoom`, so a sleeping guest fell
  through to the ROAM block at the bottom, which reads "past BED_HOUR, has a
  key" and sends them back to `toRoom` — and they are stood at their own door,
  so the very next frame put them back to `inRoom`. **Every frame, all night.**
  What the player saw is exactly what that does: `drawCustomer` skips an
  `inRoom` guest (the hotel door draws them), so the body blinked in and out of
  the world at 60Hz, and the card alternated between `OFF TO ROOM 4` and
  `ASLEEP IN ROOM 4`. The click itself was part of it — the world's click
  handler skips `inRoom`, so an in-room guest was only ever selectable on the
  half of the frames the bug produced. **Fixed with a one-line `inRoom` guard**
  in the mover; `visTick()` already owned the night (bed drain + the morning
  checkout) and always had.
  - **It was not only cosmetic.** `visTick` skips the needs loop only on an
    `inRoom` frame, so half of every night in a paid $13 bed was billed as a
    night on the promenade: hunger, thirst, dirt and boredom all climbed while
    the guest slept, and tiredness drained at half rate. The fix restores what
    the code was written to do rather than compensating for it, so **the frozen
    day-2 fingerprint was re-baselined with the receipt in the scenario** — a
    rested guest wants less, and day two sells a little less of everything
    (seed 1337: serves 66→63, till 228.8→188.6; seed 4242: serves and rep
    unmoved, one walkout fewer). Over thirty days it reads the other way, which
    is the point of measuring: **`--days 30 --seeds 16` control 0/16, median
    11** (6,8,9,9,10,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,13,13,14,15, lifetime $52,842 — an
    exact re-measure of the merged visitor pass's figure) **vs fixed 0/16,
    median 12** (10,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,13,13,13,13,14, lifetime
    $57,069). **Lose-by-default is untouched**; a guest who actually sleeps
    wakes up rested rather than ruined, stays a little longer and leaves a
    little happier, so the tails tighten (worst seed 6 days → 10) and lifetime
    is +8%. Nothing was tuned — no price, wage or rent moved.
  - Pinned by scenario **"hotel: a guest asleep in their room holds ONE state,
    and the card holds still"**, asserted THROUGH THE DRAW PATH — rendering
    switched back on against the stub ctx, each frame signed by what the card
    printed and whether the guest's body was blitted. On the unfixed build it
    reports two distinct frames and prints both cards side by side.
  - **One fixture repaired on the way past, and it was already broken.**
    `fish market: floor-price week` froze SUDSY's till under the $260 posting
    threshold so a $2 fish price could not simply poach SALTY off the pier —
    but the visitor pass gave the town a SECOND peer owner and nobody extended
    the freeze. REEF was hiring SALTY onto the hotel desk on day 4 of that
    fixture on BOTH sides of this fix; the "$45" it was passing on and the
    "$67" it failed on are both a $23 hotel wage, and neither was ever about
    fish. The freeze now walks `Object.values(OWNERS)` — it passes on the
    unfixed build too, which is how you tell a repaired fixture from a moved
    goalpost. **Any new peer owner has to be added to that pattern, or the
    scenario quietly stops testing what it says it tests.**
  - **FOUND, NOT FIXED — "ROOM undefined" on the visitor card.** `k.room` is
    reserved the moment a visitor sets off for the hotel (`visGo`), but
    `k.roomN` is only set by `checkIn()` at the desk. If the desk shuts while
    they walk, `updateVisitor`'s toBiz branch drops them to `roam` and clears
    `k.biz` — and leaves the reservation on. At BED_HOUR they let themselves
    into a room they never paid for: `custStatus` reads `ASLEEP IN ROOM ?` and
    the card's money row prints a literal **`ROOM undefined`** (measured on
    seeds 1337 / 4242 / 909, ~200-340 sampled ticks each over five days, every
    one `served: false`). Left alone deliberately: the honest fix releases the
    reservation when the desk shuts, which is a SIM change — it takes a free
    bed away, pushes those guests onto the sand and moves reputation, and that
    is a balance call with its own matrix run, not a rendering fix.
  - Two things deliberately left alone: an in-room guest is **not** clickable
    in the world any more (behind a door, exactly like a bather behind a
    curtain — the click handler always said so, the bug was what made it
    reachable), and tourists are still out of the cycler for the reasons in the
    CYCLE THE FOCUS entry below.
- **THE HOTELIER: BRASS TAKES THE DRIFTWOOD** (Matt's directive, built
  2026-08-19, worktree - verbatim and complete: *"also a new crab needs to own
  the hotel"* ... *"probably competition"*.)

  **THE FAULT.** REEF keeps the Driftwood, and REEF was written as a SOFT
  TOUCH - *"an old crab with no heir, and a fair price will always tempt him"*.
  That is a lovely sentence and it made the hotel a SHOP THE PLAYER BUYS: seven
  rooms sitting at the far end of the promenade with a price on them, and
  nobody on the other side of the counter who wanted anything. The directive
  asks for the other thing.

  ### 1. WHO SHE IS
  **BRASS** - red shell, sunglasses, drives a beach buggy, keeps a tidy house.
  She gets off the morning bus at the west stop with **$800**, drives the
  length of the town, and buys the Driftwood off REEF at REEF's own price. Then
  she runs it: the board goes up when the house fills, the board comes down
  when the beds go begging, and when a guest ends up on the sand because
  housekeeping never got to a room, she posts a wage over the best rate in town
  until somebody answers. **Her policy IS her personality** and you learn it
  the way you learn SUDSY's - by reading what she does in the day report, every
  night she does something, with the number that caused it printed beside it.
  She is not a villain: she is the first crab in this town who treats it as a
  business, and everything she does is a setting the player also holds.

  ### 2. SHE GETS THERE FIRST, and that is the competition starting
  - **SHE IS HEARD OF BEFORE SHE IS SEEN** (`WARN_DAYS` 2). Two settlements of
    *"A BUYER WANTS THE HOTEL - $552"* and *"THE HOTEL HAS A BUYER WAITING -
    $581"* in the day report before she signs, on the rivalry's own rule that a warning is guaranteed by the CLOCK
    and not by money happening to cross a line. If the player buys the
    Driftwood off REEF in that window, she never comes at all - the race is
    real, and winning it is the cleanest counter there is.
  - **SHE ONLY COMES FOR A HOUSE THAT IS TAKING MONEY** (`WORTH` 60 against the
    same three-day book `askingPrice` reads, and never before `MIN_DAY` 5).
    Competition arrives in a town that is working. A town whose hotel never got
    going never meets her, which is a large part of why the do-nothing baseline
    barely moves.
  - **SHE BRINGS A FIXED NUMBER, NOT "WHATEVER IT COSTS"** (`BANKROLL` 800). A
    Driftwood trading well enough is genuinely out of her reach and the report
    says so with both numbers on it, rather than quietly inventing the money.
    Her bankroll is the only place besides a visitor's ferry wallet where money
    enters this town and it happens ONCE. The price leaves her wallet the same
    evening and none of it is destroyed - half into REEF's pocket, half into
    the hotel's own drawer as its opening float - and the change is an ordinary
    crab wallet from then on, drained by house rent and counters like anybody's.
    It is written into the OWNERS block's inflation audit.
  - **SHE BUYS IT THROUGH THE PLAYER'S OWN PATH.** `buyOutOwner(b, buyer)` took
    a buyer argument and nothing else changed: the same listing, at the same
    `offerPrice`, in the same transaction, with the seller banking exactly what
    left the buyer's pocket. Suite-measured across the transaction itself
    (settlement also collects REEF's house rent, and $10 of landlord is not a
    leak in the deal). It is one settlement call, so the lease is never seen
    unowned and never seen held twice - pinned by a per-tick watcher.

  ### 3. A SOFT TOUCH IS A FACT ABOUT THE OWNER, NOT ABOUT THE LEASE
  `sellable` stayed on the BIZ, but the willingness moved to the OWNERS row
  (`soft: true`, and it saves). REEF is a willing seller; the crab who buys him
  out is not, and neither is a fisher who takes the hotel on after a failure.
  The payoff is that the whole change is legible on one 11-pixel chip:
  - while REEF has it, the sign wears **OFFER $N** - his fair price, and on
    seed 1337 that is what she pays him: **$608** on day 7;
  - the moment she signs it wears **BUY $N** instead - `goingConcern` plus the
    hold-out premium every peer shop's ASK already carries. Same seed, day 23,
    same seven rooms: REEF's rule would read **$584** and hers reads **$749**.
  **A pre-existing fault fell out of this**: a trading shop with a willing
  owner qualified for the OFFER chip (y105) *and* the peer ASK chip (y104), so
  the Driftwood drew two labels on top of each other from the day it shipped -
  and the hit-test, which checks `peerBizList()` first, gave the tap to the
  DEARER of the two prices. REEF's fair number was unreachable. `peerBizList()`
  now excludes a shop that `canOffer`: one shop, one price, and the willing
  seller's own number wins.

  ### 4. THE TWO LEVERS, and what they cost the player
  One move every `STEP_DAYS` 2, announced by name, and never two in a night.
  | lever | her signal | what it does to the player |
  |---|---|---|
  | **THE BOARD** `setBizPrice("hotel", +-5%)` | beds SOLD tonight (`today.roomsLet`): `FULL` 0.70 of the rooms puts it up, `SLACK` 0.30 brings it down | `visPick` holds the BOARD price of a bed back before a visitor buys anything else, so every step she takes is a step off the town's supper money. Zero sum, exactly like the promenade. |
  | **THE WAGE** `setBizWage("hotel", best + 2)` | a guest asleep on the beach with a bed standing UNMADE (`today.roomsLost`) - a sale her laundry cost her, not her demand | `townWage()` is a MEAN over the shops that are hiring, so her raise moves every crab's `goingRate`, which moves the crew's `payRatio`, which is the grievance ladder that was already there. She poaches by moving the market, not by a special case. |
  - **A DARK DAY IS NOT A PRICE SIGNAL.** Her own rest day, an uncovered shift,
    a shop shut on a missed rent - all of them read as "nought beds sold" and
    none of them says the room is too dear. The day book is the honest test
    (`bizDayBook("hotel").take > 0`), and it is suite-pinned.
  - **IT CONVERGES, and it costs her.** The dead band between FULL and SLACK is
    wide, and the loop self-limits from both ends: a dearer room sells fewer
    beds. When the Driftwood takes a rent STRIKE she walks the last move back
    in public - the wage first, because the wage is the only one of the two
    that costs cash on the night. Reading her TILL instead was rejected for the
    reason the rivalry already measured: a seven-room lease settles all over
    the place, so a till gate makes a rival who never moves.
  - **THE FIRST RAISE IS ABSORBED.** One shop going to $25 in a town whose
    other counter pays $20 leaves `townWage()` under the standard day and
    nobody feels a thing; the SECOND one lands. That is the honest shape of
    this lever and the suite pins it rather than pretending otherwise.

  ### 5. WHERE YOU READ HER - no new panel, anywhere
  The day report's RIVAL block (every move, plus a quiet-night line carrying
  beds-sold and her rate), a named toast on the night, her own DIARY page
  (*"PUTS THE ROOM UP TO $15 - 5/7 SOLD"*), her dossier and the TOWN
  census like any owner-operator, the job board's payroll list, the SCHEDULE
  tab's `TOWN $x / PIER $y` line - which is exactly where her raise shows up
  against the player's own rate - and the ASK chip on her shopfront.

  ### 6. TWO MORE FAULTS FOUND ON THE WAY, both reachable before this pass
  (three, with the day report's own trimming - see the suite note below)
  1. **A REPRICED BOARD WAS NOT CHECKED AGAINST THE WALLET.** `visPick`'s
     affordability test read the RECIPE table (`r.pay`) while every till in the
     game charges `menuPrice`, and the room money a visitor holds back
     (`roomReserve`) read `ROOM_RATE` for the same reason. Put any board over
     100% - the player's own stepper does it - and a visitor joins a line they
     cannot clear; `payAndBenefit` then takes what the wallet holds, clamped at
     zero, and credits the owner the FULL board price. **The difference is
     minted**, which is the one thing the OWNERS audit says can never happen.
     The crabs' own `pickErrand` has always read `localPrice`; this was the
     single check that did not, and the hotel is now the shop most likely to be
     repriced. Everything reads `roomPrice()` now. Default 1 is untouched
     (`Math.round(pay * 1) === pay`).
  2. **THE TWO WALKOUT PATHS FOUGHT OVER ONE COUNTER.** The bored walkout wrote
     `_stats.walkouts` as a COUNT and the pay walkout wrote it as a ROW, so a
     town that took one of each in that order died with
     `_stats.walkouts.push is not a function`. Found by the matrix, on the
     `--seedbase 8` growth block, because her wage lever makes pay walkouts
     commoner than they were. `window._stats` is headless-only, but the
     headless matrix is how every balance number in this file is measured and a
     harness that throws is a matrix that lies. Both write rows now.

  ### 7. Balance - the hatch is the attribution
  `--nohotelier` keeps REEF behind the desk, and the OFF arm of the baseline
  reproduces the documented HEAD list **exactly**, which is the receipt that
  everything above is behaviour-identical when she is switched off:

  | matrix | `--nohotelier` | live | documented HEAD |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16` | 0/16, median **11** (6,8,9,9,10,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,13,13,14,15), lifetime $52,842 | **0/16, median 11** (6,8,9,9,9,10,10,11,11,12,12,13,14,14,14,16), lifetime $52,358 (**-0.9%**) | 0/16, median 11, same list as the OFF arm |
  | growth `--buy chef,table` 40d x 8 | 2/8, 6,8,9,10,14,15,41,41 (median 14), lifetime $65,460 | **2/8, 6,8,9,9,13,19,41,41 (median 13), lifetime $65,752 (+0.4%)** | 2/8 |
  | growth, second block `--seedbase 8` | 3/8, 11,11,12,15,17,41,41,41 (median 17), lifetime $77,148 | **3/8, 10,12,12,13,18,41,41,41 (median 18), lifetime $76,859 (-0.4%)** | 3/8 |

  Across both growth blocks the escape count is **5/16 with her and 5/16
  without**, and BOTH `--nohotelier` arms reproduce this file's documented HEAD
  lists character for character (baseline 6,8,9,9,10,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,13,
  13,14,15; growth 6,8,9,10,14,15,41,41; second block 11,11,12,15,17,41,41,41).
  That is the receipt that the two bug fixes above are behaviour-identical at
  the default board price - `Math.round(pay * 1) === pay` - and that every
  difference in the live column is HER.

  **She lands in most towns**: 13 of 16 baseline seeds and 14 of 16 growth
  seeds, around **day 7-12**. Lose-by-default is absolute (0/16) and the median
  sits inside CLAUDE.md's documented 11-13 band.

  **WHAT SHE ACTUALLY COSTS, paired arms inside the same build** (4 propped
  towns x 20 days, coins held up so the eviction cannot confound the demand;
  she lands on day 9.5 on average):

  | | `--nohotelier` | BRASS |
  |---|---|---|
  | the room rate she settles on | $13 | **$16 (+23%)** |
  | visitor money spent in town | $40,492 | **$42,118 (+4.0%)** |
  | ...of which the PLAYER's lifetime | $37,028 | $36,967 (**-0.2%**) |
  | seatings | 1,363 | 1,335 (-2.1%) |
  | rooms let | 438 | 479 (+9.4%) |
  | crew grievance, town-wide | **0.00** | **0.34** (GRUMBLE is 0.35) |

  Read those rows together and the design is in the table. She takes about
  **$20 a town-day more out of the same purses** and the shack's takings do not
  rise to meet it, because the promenade is zero sum and a bed is paid for
  before a supper is. The labour half of it shows up in the growth matrix,
  where the second block measured both arms after the counter fix:
  **175 walkout-days against 126, +39%** (that counter holds pay walkouts AND
  bored ones, so it is the town's total refusal-to-work, not a pay-only
  number - the pay half is what her wage lever owns and the crew grievance row
  above is the cleaner read of it).

  **AND WHAT THE PLAYER CAN DO ABOUT IT**, cheapest first:
  1. **WIN THE RACE.** Two settlements of warning with REEF's price on the sign
     the whole time. On seed 1337 that window reads **$552, $581, $608** - it
     goes UP while you think about it, because the Driftwood is trading - and
     by day 23 her own sign reads **$749** for the same seven rooms. Waiting
     cost **$165**, and it is painted on the shopfront both times.
  2. **PAY THE CREW.** Her raise reaches them through `townWage()`, and the
     SCHEDULE tab has printed `TOWN $x / PIER $y` beside the player's own rate
     since the wage pass. It is a bill, not a trap: two of her raises put the
     crew on the GRUMBLE line, and a dollar puts them back.
  3. **BUY HER OUT.** The number on her sign IS the negotiation - it is
     `goingConcern`, so a Driftwood taking less money is a cheaper Driftwood.
     Honest caveat, and it is measured rather than hoped: the player has far
     less leverage over a hotel's books than over a juice bar's, so this is the
     expensive door rather than the clever one.

  **What was tuned, and it was all my own knobs** (never a price, a wage or a
  rent that existed before this pass): `MIN_DAY`, `WORTH`, `WARN_DAYS`,
  `BANKROLL`, `FULL`/`SLACK`, `STEP_DAYS`, `WAGE_OVER` and `TILL_FLOOR`.

  ### 8. REEF is kept, and he does not retire quietly
  Replacing him at founding would have been a rename plus a re-pointing for
  every fixture that names him (the housing exclusion, the lot table, the
  save/load roster, the opening-rates roster, the hotel's own scenario) and a
  re-baselined day-2 fingerprint, for a worse story. Keeping him costs
  **zero re-pointings**: BRASS does not exist on day 3, so every founding
  fixture, the housing row, the lot table and the frozen fingerprint are
  untouched - and his soft-touch line becomes the door she walks through
  instead of a dead end. He is laid off by the sale like any other staff (the
  same thing happens when the PLAYER buys him out), banks his half of the
  price, and goes back to the rail a rich crab - and the succession layer takes
  it from there. On seed 1337 he bought SUDS SHOWERS for $180 three days later
  when SUDSY died, which quietly makes the old hotelier the JUICE BAR's rival,
  because THE RIVALRY keys on that lease and not on SUDSY. Nobody wrote that.

  ### Story beat (organic, reproducible - seed 1337, no buys)
  `node tools/headless.mjs --days 22 --seeds 1`, and it is all in the day
  report. **D5**: *A BUYER WANTS THE HOTEL - $552.* **D6**: *THE HOTEL HAS A
  BUYER WAITING - $581* - the Driftwood is trading, so the price of it climbs
  while you think about it. **D7**: **$608**, and *BRASS BOUGHT THE HOTEL OFF
  REEF - $608.* **D8**: *BRASS PUTS THE ROOM UP TO $14 - 7/7 SOLD*, and
  the board walks $14, $15, $16, $17 across a fortnight of full houses - every
  step announced with the count that caused it. **D20**: *BRASS DROPS THE ROOM
  TO $16 - 2/7 SOLD*, and **D22** she puts it straight back. And in the middle of that,
  **D10**: *REEF HAS THE SHWR NOW.* SUDSY died, and the old hotelier - flush
  with the $304 BRASS paid him - bought the shower house off the market three
  days after losing his own. Nobody wrote that beat: THE RIVALRY keys on the
  showers LEASE, so the crab BRASS bought out is now the one standing outside
  the player's juice bar.

  ### 9. Suite 139 -> 145, and ONE re-pointing worth reading
  New: `hotelier: a new crab buys the Driftwood, and the lease is never in two
  hands` (the warning before the sale, a per-tick watch for an unowned or
  double-held lease, conservation measured ACROSS the transaction, and REEF
  landing on his feet); `hotelier: her board moves with the house, her wage
  moves the whole town` (both levers, the dark-day guard, the first raise being
  absorbed and the second one reaching the player's crew, and the retreat on a
  missed rent); `hotelier: one price on the hotel's sign, and it goes UP the
  day she signs` (the two-chip overlap, her hold-out premium, and the player
  buying her out); `visitors: a repriced board is checked against the wallet
  (nothing is minted)` (a wrapper on `payAndBenefit` watching every visitor
  charge with every board at 130%); `hotelier: she roundtrips save/load with
  her lease, her board and her ledger` (plus an old save that never met her and
  a hand-edited one); `measurement: a bored walkout and a pay walkout share one
  counter`. **THREE of them go RED on the pre-pass build for BEHAVIOURAL reasons
  rather than a ReferenceError** (checked by reverting the three fixes on this
  tree and running them): *"the hotel wears an OFFER chip and an ASK chip in
  the same slot"*, *"4 of 105 visitor charges came out of a wallet that could
  not cover them, e.g. PEARL, shack, fish, $17 of $17"*, and *"the bored
  walkout writes a number where the pay walkout writes rows"*.
  A fourth pre-existing overflow was fixed on the way and is pinned by
  measurement rather than by eye: the day report never trimmed a RIVAL line to
  the card, and every line the hotelier writes is now checked against the
  card's own 164px with `smallTextWidth` inside the scenario.

  **THE ONE RE-POINTING, and it is the counter fix paying for itself.**
  `wage: the shipped defaults are behaviour-identical` gated on
  `(_stats.walkouts || []).length` - and the BORED walkout was overwriting that
  counter with a NUMBER, so `.length` came back `undefined` and **the gate had
  never once looked**. With both paths writing rows it saw five bored days off
  in a default town and went red, correctly. A bored walkout is a different
  feature legitimately firing (boredom DRIFTS, 2026-08-19); what that gate owns
  is the WAGE feature's inertness, so the pay row now carries `why: "pay"` and
  the gate counts those. The default town still has ZERO wage walkouts.

  ### 10. What was deliberately NOT built
  - **A SECOND RIVALRY STATE MACHINE.** `rival` is one object, one PRIZE, one
    SHOP, and making it a keyed map so BRASS could run EYEING -> OFFER ->
    COMPETE against a player-owned Driftwood is a refactor of ~600 lines and
    every scenario that pokes `rival.*`, to re-tell a beat the town already
    has. She plugs into the pieces instead: the same three levers, the same
    retreat rule, the same `goingConcern`/ASK machinery, the same day-report
    channel. If the player owns the hotel she simply never comes - they won the
    race, and that is a clean outcome rather than a hole.
  - **THE HOTEL SERVING FOOD.** It only becomes a real decision if a guest can
    prefer it to the shack for a reason, which means recipes, a kitchen
    station, staff to cook them and a second dining room competing for the same
    four tourist queue slots - and drawn furniture in the one shopfront this
    pass is not allowed to touch. Bolted on as a bizPull weight it is either
    inert or a straight tax with no lever against it, which is a number that
    drifts rather than a rivalry.
  - **AN HOURS LEVER.** The hotel still has no `HOURS_POLICY` row. A third
    lever would have needed its own attribution arm and the two measured ones
    are enough to feel.
  - **ANY CHANGE TO THE HOTEL'S DRAW CODE** (another agent is on a night-time
    flicker there), and nothing at all near the shelter, the town fund or
    charity.
- **STANDING IN LINE** (owner directive, built 2026-08-20, worktree — verbatim
  and complete: *"crabs need to stand in line nicely"*). Positional only: not
  one capacity, price, wage or service rule moved, and two obvious-looking
  companion changes were MEASURED AND REFUSED (below).

  ### THE FAULT — three of them, and none was the spacing
  A place in a line was `BIZ[k.biz].queueX + (qi[k.biz]++) * QUEUE_DX`, where
  `qi` counts up the `customers` ARRAY. Since the ferry pass a visitor lives in
  that array for their whole stay, so **the line was ordered by which boat you
  came off**, not by when you walked up to the counter. A guest who landed on
  the 09:00 ferry and strolled up fourth took the spot at the window and pushed
  everyone already standing there back a place.
  1. **NO STEP BACK.** The shuffle was `if (k.x > slot) k.x = Math.max(slot,
     k.x - 45 * dt)` — one way, toward the counter. So anybody pushed back a
     place never moved at all: they simply stood INSIDE the crab in front.
  2. **LOCALS WERE NOT IN THE SYSTEM.** `startErrand` walked a crab to
     `queueX + 4` and its customer record was created at that x. Being LEFT of
     every slot it never moved again, so **every neighbour in a line stood on
     the same pixel** — and a crab holding an `errandCust` is exempt from
     `collide()`, so nothing pushed them apart either.
  3. Visitors settled within visStep's 1px tolerance, so a line stood on five
     different y values.

  Measured on the shipped build, seed 4242, three sim-days, every frame, over
  every pair of crabs waiting at the same counter:

  | | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | pair-frames closer than 8px (half a body) | **57.7%** | **0.0%** |
  | pair-frames on the SAME PIXEL (<1px apart) | **7900** | **0** |
  | pairs in the wrong order (later arrival nearer the counter) | **25.5%** | **0.0%** |
  | smallest gap between two waiting crabs, ever | **0.00px** | **13.00px** |
  | mean \|gap − QUEUE_DX\| between neighbours | — | **0.05px** |
  | y spread across a line | mean 0.32, max 0.90 | **0.00** |
  | direction flips (the flicker class) | 5 | **0** |

  Widened to 8 towns x 4 days (132k waiting pairs): **0 inversions against the
  join order and 0 pairs inside a 12px body.** Shots, both at the shack window,
  both frozen with `FF_SPEED[0] = 0` (TURBO is a `const`, so that is the way to
  stop the world for a picture): `shots/queue-before.png` is the shipped build
  with three guests and two neighbours joining in order — two crabs inside each
  other at x1566/x1570 and a 26px hole further out; `shots/queue-after.png` is
  this build with a line nobody staged at all, four guests at 1566/1579/1592/
  1605 in join order, all facing the counter.

  ### THE FIX — a queue is an ORDER, not an array
  - `queueJoin(k)` stamps a monotonic `k.qSeq` **when you join a line** — the
    local's customer record at the moment it is pushed, the visitor when
    `toBiz` ends and they become `arriving`, a walk-in in `newCustomer()`.
    `queueOrder(b)` sorts a shop's line by it (and lazily stamps anything that
    got into a line without a ticket, so the order is always total).
  - `updateCustomers` builds one Map of customer -> slot per frame, so a place
    is a POSITION IN THE QUEUE. Rebuilt every frame is what compacts the line
    when the front is served: everybody behind moves up exactly one place.
  - The shuffle steps **both ways**, clamped to the distance left
    (`Math.abs(dxq) <= QUEUE_STEP * dt` snaps). No overshoot means nothing to
    correct next frame, which is the whole anti-jitter argument; and a settled
    waiter faces the counter (`face = -1`), so a line reads as a line.
  - `startErrand` aims a local at **the back of the line**
    (`queueSlotX(e.biz, queueLen(e.biz))`), and `updateErrand` **re-aims while
    the crab walks** — the line is alive, three guests can form up while you
    cross the promenade, and a fixed aim lands you inside them. Re-aimed only
    when the tail actually moves, so it is one comparison per crab.
  - `drawCustomer` animates a waiter that is actually shuffling
    (`k.qWalk`), so a step-up reads as walking rather than the whole line
    sliding up the boardwalk on its belly.

  ### TWO REFUSALS, both measured rather than argued
  - **SERVING THE FRONT OF THE LINE — REFUSED.** The obvious companion change:
    sort `pending` in `updateKitchen` into queue order so the crab who is
    handed the plate is the crab standing at the window. It is an ECONOMIC
    change, because the tip is `menuPrice x 0.5 x patience/maxPatience` — FIFO
    takes every tip at the BOTTOM of the patience curve. Measured, 30d x 16
    seeds x two blocks: lifetime **$53447/$57086 unsorted against
    $49914/$48958 sorted (−8% and −14%)**, while the geometry alone reads
    +2%/−1%. Reverted, with the receipt in a comment at the call site. If Matt
    wants queue-order service it is a deliberate economy change, not a paint job.
  - **QUEUE_DX / QUEUE_MAX / TOURIST_QUEUE_MAX — UNTOUCHED.** 13px is a shade
    over the collider's own 12px body, so a line is spaced exactly the way
    crabs stand everywhere else in town. The reserved 5th slot is untouched.

  ### ONE THING FIXED NEXT DOOR — two chefs, one crate
  Falling out of the same "everybody gets their own place" idea, and reported
  loudly because it is outside the queue: **every crab that claims an order
  walked to source slot ZERO**, and the source is the one station nothing
  acquires. Two chefs converging on it shove each other off it, and the
  standoff is invisible to every guard we have — the crab is 3px short of its
  target, inside `STUCK_FAR`, so the no-progress watchdog reads it as arrived,
  and no FURNITURE is involved so the bounce budget never ticks. Measured, the
  suite's own "no crab freezes mid-walk (full town)" detector over 12 seeds:
  **the pre-pass build already trips it (seed 4011, 23s), and the queue pass
  moved which seed trips it (4242, 28s).** `sourceSpot()` stands the second
  crab one body BEHIND the first, out on the walkway where no counter band
  reaches. Two things make it FREE, and both were bought with a measurement:
  - it is **decided on arrival**, re-read every frame of the walk to the crate,
    not reserved at claim time. Reserving up front made the second chef of
    every busy service walk an extra body-width whether or not anybody was
    there: **−9% of lifetime take over 48 towns** (three 16-seed blocks:
    $49775/$51680/$50854 against the geometry-only build's
    $54494/$56501/$56176). Deciding late costs the steps only when it is
    actually needed, and reads +3%/−11%/+1%.
  - it is **scoped to that shop's own staff**. A first cut looked at every crab
    in town within 10px, so a passer-by on the boardwalk could shove SUDSY off
    her own counter: her time on the dehydration line went 10% → 36%. Scoped,
    it is 17.7%, against the 18.7% the tap scenario already documents. A
    ONE-STAFF shop is bit-identical to the shipped build.

  After: **the worst freeze over those 12 seeds is 5 ticks, against the
  pre-pass build's 23.**

  ### Balance — flat, and the drift attributed
  Baseline 30d x 16 on **three** seed blocks: **0/16, 0/16, 0/16** (0/48 on both
  builds), median eviction 12/11/12 against the pre-pass build's 11/12/11,
  lifetime $54956/$50608/$56177 against $53447/$57086/$55832 — +3%, −11%, +1%,
  signs in both directions, which is what noise looks like. Growth 40d x 16
  `--buy chef,table`: 4/16 against 5/16, inside the coin CLAUDE.md documents.
  Paired arm, 8 propped towns x 4 days (same buys, coins held up): tourist
  serves 953 -> 963, local serves 94 -> 101, seatings 535 -> 533, take
  $14188 -> $14238.

  ### Suite
  One new scenario, **"queues: arrival order, even spacing, a smooth step-up
  and no jitter"** — stages guests whose ARRAY order is the reverse of their
  JOIN order plus a neighbour on an errand, then watches 120 frames of settling
  and 120 more after the front walks off, asserting per frame that nobody moves
  further than one shuffle (the teleport gate), nobody reverses direction (the
  flicker gate), and on the settled frame that every crab stands on its own
  slot in join order with no pair inside a 12px body. On the pre-pass build the
  same staging settles **exactly reversed** — last to join at the window.
  THREE existing scenarios were RE-POINTED, each with its receipt in the file,
  and all three for the same reason: the pass moves the town by seconds, and a
  scenario pinned to one seed of a chaotic sim flips.
  - the **frozen day-2 fingerprint** — re-baselined; the 30-day curve above is
    the receipt.
  - the **shower fixture**, which sent crabs[0] on an 80-game-minute walk that
    landed inside SUDSY's last hour, so she knocked off with the crab in
    `waitStall` and the assertion read a tap rinse. A coin that failed **9 of
    24 seeds on the pre-pass build** and 6 on this one. Staged at the counter
    with the showers open, staffed, two hours off closing and a clean stall
    free: 0/28 and 1/28. The assertion is untouched.
  - the **rivalry counter probe** (`rivalry: after a refusal…`) — flagged
    LOUDLY because rivalry belongs to another pass. Its price-war A/B turned on
    one nine-day town and 30-80 drink serves: BAD on **2 of 6 single seeds on
    the pre-pass build** and 3 of 6 on this one, and the seed it pinned (909)
    was simply on the lucky side before. Now pooled over three towns
    (1337/4242/5348), which reads 0.302 -> 0.342 on the pre-pass build and
    0.387 -> 0.409 on this one. **The rivalry CODE was not touched.**

- **CYCLE THE FOCUS + SUDSY WANTS THE JUICE BAR** (two owner directives, built
  2026-08-19, worktree — verbatim: *"need a single small pictorial next/prev
  crab button to cycle focus"* and *"sudsy needs to want to buy the juice shop,
  that's a major antagonism that could develop"*).

  ### 1. THE CYCLER — `< 🦀 >`, and nothing else
  A pictorial next/prev under the little sun: a chevron, the selected crab's own
  shell, a chevron. No words, so it reads the same in any language.
  - **WHAT IT CYCLES**: `cycleList()` is literally `allCrabs()` — crew first,
    then townsfolk, the town's own roster order. Visiting TOURISTS are
    deliberately OUT: they are customer objects that arrive and go home
    mid-cycle, so a list containing them has no stable length and "wrap around"
    stops meaning anything. You can still click a tourist to follow one; the
    cycler then treats them as "nothing selected" and `>` steps to the first
    crab in town, `<` to the last.
  - **IT TAKES THE CAMERA WITH IT.** Selection and camera are separate in this
    game (a drag drops the camera and keeps the selection), so the cycler goes
    through `followCrab()` and sets BOTH — the same call the dossier's FOLLOW
    chip makes. Suite-pinned: the camera converges on the cycled crab from a
    panned-away start (626px → 4px in four sim-seconds).
  - **WHERE IT LIVES**: top-right, `y=29..46`, directly under the sun and clear
    of the REP chip above it and the BILL/DEBT chips at the bottom. Rows
    `0..PANEL_Y` are the world area in BOTH canvas modes, so the geometry is
    H-independent and 240 and 288 get the identical control (shot in both). It
    is deliberately NOT beside the follow card: the card only exists when
    something is selected, and the whole point of the control is to work when
    nothing is. It hides behind the ledger, the management card, the census,
    the save screen and the day report on exactly the terms the follow card
    does — those cards own the screen when they are open.
  - **THUMB-SIZED**: 48x17 in three targets, the smallest 14x17 — bigger than
    the SCHEDULE tab's 16x15 wage steppers. Tapping the crab in the middle
    re-engages the camera on the crab you already have, the same job the follow
    card's portrait does. `[` and `]` do the same from the keyboard.
  - **BEHAVIOUR-NEUTRAL**: it reads no sim state and writes none. The frozen
    day-2 fingerprint passes **untouched**.

  ### 2. THE RIVALRY — a peer owner comes for a business that is doing FINE
  Peer owners already ran shops, set hours, set wages, hired, and bought a
  FAILED business off the market. Nobody ever came for one that was WORKING.
  - **IT KEYS ON THE LEASE NEXT DOOR, NOT ON SUDSY** (`rivalOwnerId()` =
    `bizOwner("showers")`). This is the single most load-bearing decision in
    the pass and it was forced by measurement: **SUDS SHOWERS fails in most
    long runs** and a fisher buys it off the market, so a rivalry hard-wired to
    `"sudsy"` was dead content from the day her lease changed hands. Keyed on
    the BUSINESS — exactly the way `HOURS_POLICY` and `WAGE_POLICY` are — the
    new holder inherits the ambition, and the war chest goes back to whoever
    saved it. A lease in the PLAYER's hands has no rival behind it at all.
  - **AMBITION IS ARITHMETIC YOU CAN DO YOURSELF.** `rivalIntent()` is
    *derived, never accumulated*: what she can RAISE over what the bar is
    WORTH. Raise = a war chest she banks out of her own till on clean nights
    (`BANK_KEEP 100 / BANK_FRAC 0.5 / BANK_MAX 60`, raided back before she
    misses a rent) + the till + her own pocket + the headroom on the SAME line
    of credit the player draws on (a business line: a crab with no lease has
    none, which is what makes "starve her shop of trade" a real counter).
    Worth = the succession layer's own `askingPrice` — lease + fixtures +
    goodwill — plus `PREMIUM 0.35 x (0.5 + 2 x health)` for a going concern,
    then SMOOTHED (`SMOOTH 0.3`): a three-day takings book on a small shop
    swings 2x overnight and a number that moves like that cannot be the basis
    of an offer.
  - **THE STAGES, and you feel every one of them coming.**
    | | gate | what the town sees |
    |---|---|---|
    | EYEING | raise ≥ **0.35** of worth (hysteresis: drops out under **0.18**) | a toast, a **day-report line every single night** with the two numbers in it, a diary entry, a line on the management screen and the job board — and she takes her idle-hands break standing outside the bar ("SIZING UP THE JUICE BAR") |
    | OFFER | ≥ **0.45** of worth AND **≥ 3 settlements** of being seen there (the warning is guaranteed by the CLOCK, not by money crossing two lines in the right order) | a banner over the bar's roofline, TAKE IT / NO chips at counter height, the price AND what the place is worth |
    | COMPETE | refused, or ignored for `ANSWER_DAYS 3` | one lever every `STEP_DAYS 2`, each one announced by name |
    | ...and back | `REOFFER 5` days after a NO | a fresh number, usually a different one |
  - **THE OFFER IS WHAT SHE CAN PUT ON THE TABLE**, capped at what the place is
    worth and floored at `LOWBALL 0.35` of it, keeping `FLOAT_NIGHTS 1` of the
    bar's rent back so she can open it in the morning. A lowball is a real
    outcome and the card shows both numbers, so refusing a lowball is easy and
    refusing a fair one is a genuine decision.
  - **ACCEPT**: the whole price moves from her pots to yours. A sale between two
    owners is a TRANSFER, not the lease re-letting that destroys half at a FOR
    SALE sign — there is a seller here and the seller is you. It does NOT go
    through `earn()`: a business sale is not trading revenue and must not
    inflate `lifetime` or the income-rate chip. Your crew come back to your
    kitchen (they are under contract to you); she runs the bar off the same
    `HOURS_POLICY` / `WAGE_POLICY` / `autoLabor` tables and posts for staff on
    the same job board. Suite-measured: the bar takes $150+/day under her.
  - **REFUSE**: nothing punitive. She competes, on three levers the player also
    holds and that already existed:
    1. **PRICE** — `setBizPrice("showers", -10%)` down to the stepper's own
       floor. Tourists read boards (see THE PRICE below).
    2. **HOURS** — `setBizHours` +1h at the close, then earlier at the open.
    3. **WAGE** — `setBizWage` to $2 over the best rate in town, which moves
       `townWage()`, which moves your crew's `payRatio`, which is the existing
       grievance ladder. She poaches by moving the market, not by a special case.
    Her own quiet-hours shrink rule **stands down while she is fighting** — one
    lever must not have two owners pulling it opposite ways.
  - **SURVIVABLE, and the trigger is a MISSED RENT.** When her lease takes a
    strike she walks the last move BACK in public ("PUTS THE SHWR PRICE BACK TO
    100% - SHE CAN'T CARRY THE FIGHT"). Reading her TILL instead was tried and
    measured **inert**: a shower house settles most nights on $0-45 whatever it
    is doing, so a till gate meant a rival who never made a single move.
  - **FIRST IN THE QUEUE.** If the bar ever FAILS, `runSuccession` asks her
    before the deepest pocket in town — she still pays the market price out of
    her own money. The antagonism paying off.
  - **AND THE OTHER WAY ROUND.** The ownership layer is symmetric: a peer
    owner's shopfront carries their **ASK**, in the exact slot a player-owned
    shop's MANAGE chip uses, because it is the same thing — the door into that
    owner's office. Two taps buys it, the SELLER IS PAID, and the owner-operator
    steps down (to another counter if they hold one). There is no haggling
    minigame because **the number IS the negotiation**: the ask is
    `goingConcern` + `HOLD 0.35 x` how much she fancies her chances + `ONLY 0.4`
    for the only shop she has, so out-competing her walks the price down.
  - **Fixed en route, a latent fault this pass made reachable**: `listForSale`
    laid off the owner-operator unconditionally, clearing `p.owner` — which
    ORPHANS that owner's OTHER shop at the next settlement, because the death
    seam reads exactly that field. `stepDownOwner()` moves them to the counter
    they still hold instead. Suite-pinned.

  ### 3. THE PRICE IS A SETTING (the last business lever)
  Hours, wages, tip share and staff meals were all data; the MENU PRICE was the
  one number still frozen into the recipe table. `BIZ[k].priceMul`, bounds
  **0.70–1.30** in 5% steps, a stepper on the management screen's HOURS tab
  beside the takings it changes, with the board it implies printed next to it.
  `menuPrice()` / `localPrice()` are the only two ways a price is ever read, so
  every charge site, every affordability check in `pickErrand`, the staff-meal
  policy, the MENU tab and the tourist card all move together.
  - **A setting is only real if somebody responds**, and two things do.
    TOURISTS read boards (`bizPull(b)` = the shop's base weight x
    `priceAppeal` = `(1/mul)^1.2`, clamped 0.6–1.6), and LOCALS can suddenly
    afford a counter that was out of reach.
  - **THE PROMENADE IS ZERO SUM, by construction.** The spawn INTERVAL is
    computed from the UNPRICED weights, so a price cut takes trade off the shop
    next door and never conjures guests out of the sea. That is what makes a
    price war a war and not a growth strategy — for the player and the rival
    alike.
  - **DEFAULT 1 IS BIT-IDENTICAL**: `Math.round(pay * 1) === pay` for every
    integer price in BIZ and `Math.pow(1, 1.2) === 1` exactly, so the RNG stream
    is untouched. Receipts below.

  ### Balance — three matrices, and defaults are BYTE-IDENTICAL
  | | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16` | 0/16, 9,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,11,12,12,12,12,13, **median 10**, lifetime **$49,354** | **byte-identical** |
  | growth `--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` | **4/8**, 9,10,12,13,41,41,41,41, lifetime **$97,299** | **byte-identical** |

  Neither documented curve can move, because the rivalry cannot fire until the
  player OWNS a juice bar and the price lever is inert at its default. The arm
  where it CAN fire is its own matrix:

  | `--buy chef,table,juicebar --days 40 --seeds 8` | alive | lifetime | drinks | tourist serves |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `--norival` | 4/8 | $95,657 | 1,183 | 4,390 |
  | rivalry live | **4/8** | **$94,455 (−1.3%)** | 1,211 | 4,368 |

  In that matrix **2 of 8 towns reach EYEING** (days 27 and 31), both make a
  real offer ($432 of $495, and $377 of $795), both are left unanswered, and one
  cuts her board price and then walks it back when she misses a rent. It is an
  endgame antagonism and it does not touch the escape promise.

  **WHAT COMPETING ACTUALLY COSTS**, paired arms inside the same build (6
  propped towns x 24 days, the bar staffed, the player refusing every offer):

  | | rivalry off | she competes | ...and the player matches her price |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | JUICE BAR takings | $9,026 | **$8,464 (−6.2%)** | $8,567 (−5.1%) |
  | drinks served | 1,478 | 1,401 | **1,650 (+11.6%)** |
  | her showers served | 1,458 | **2,354 (+61%)** | 2,222 |
  | CRAB SHACK takings | $16,975 | $17,617 | $17,805 |
  | player lifetime | $31,649 | $31,821 | $32,247 |

  Read those five rows together and the whole design is in the table. She really
  does take the trade — her stalls run 61% busier and the bar loses 6.2% of its
  takings. **Matching her price wins the VOLUME back at a thinner margin** (the
  bar serves 11.6% MORE drinks than in a town with no rival at all, for slightly
  less money). And the player's LIFETIME is a wash, because the promenade is
  zero sum and the player has more than one shop: what the bar loses, the shack
  picks up. Competing against one of your counters moves trade between them.

  **REACHABILITY** (8 seeds x 40d, the headless buyer's own plan plus the juice
  bar): 4 towns survive to day 40; **4/4 reach EYEING, 3/4 make a real offer,
  1/4 runs the entire arc** including a competition move and a retreat.

  ### Suite 116 -> 124, ZERO re-pointing
  New: the cycler (order, wrap, camera convergence from a panned-away start,
  a tourist not jamming it, both canvas modes' geometry, the hit-test driving
  what a tap drives, and getting out of the way of a full-screen card);
  `rivalry: her interest builds from HER OWN books` (with a PAIRED ARM whose
  books are empty and whose line is drawn — nothing happens); `the offer is a
  real number, and it can be ACCEPTED or REFUSED` (the itemized terms add to
  the asking price, accept moves the money to the cent including what she
  BORROWED, the crew come home, the bar keeps trading, refuse leaves everything
  where it was); `after a refusal she competes with the PLAYER'S OWN levers, and
  can be countered` (all three levers used and announced, the retreat on a
  missed rent, the zero-sum share test with a paired price arm, and the lever's
  own arithmetic); `if the juice bar FAILS she is first in the queue` (against a
  deeper pocket standing right there); `the player can buy HER shop` (the ask
  moves with her books, two taps, the seller is paid, she steps down, and the
  two-lease orphan seam); `THE LEASE IS THE RIVAL` (a new holder inherits the
  ambition and the old one gets their savings back); and the save/load roundtrip
  (prices, war chest, valuation, escalation ledger and a standing offer that is
  still answerable after the reload, plus an old save and a hand-edited one).
  **The frozen day-2 fingerprint needed NO re-baseline** — the receipt that a
  default town is untouched.
  **Caught by the suite, worth writing down**: banking the war chest from day
  one (before the player owns a bar) moved SUDSY's till by $39 on day 2 and
  tripped the fingerprint plus two other pins — a till is not an inert number,
  the job board reads it to post a vacancy and `ownerFunds` reads it to buy the
  next bar of soap. She saves only when there is something to save for.

  ### Story beat (organic, reproducible)
  `node tools/headless.mjs --days 40 --seeds 1 --seedbase 1 --buy chef,table,juicebar`
  (seed 2674). **Day 14**: SUDS SHOWERS misses its third lease. SUDSY loses the
  shop she owned outright and goes back to the rail. The town has no shower
  house for a fortnight. **Day 27**: **DRIFT**, a fisher, has $230 saved and
  buys it for $200 — and the *same night* the day report says he has been
  standing outside the juice bar. **Day 30** he offers **$432** for a bar he
  values at $495: not a lowball, a real number, 87% of what the place is worth.
  Nobody answers for three days. **Day 33** the offer lapses and he starts
  competing; **day 35** he cuts a rinse to 90%. **Day 37** he misses his own
  rent and **puts the price straight back to 100%** — the war costs him more
  than it is worth, in public, and the player never had to do anything but wait.
  **Day 38** SUDS SHOWERS fails again and DRIFT is back on the pier.
  A fortnight after SUDSY lost the lease, the lease had found somebody else to
  want the juice bar with. That is the whole thesis in one run.
  Shots: `cycler-desktop`, `cycler-portrait`, `rival-eyeing`, `rival-offer`,
  `rival-manage-price`, `rival-jobboard`, `rival-her-shop-ask`, `rival-bar-sold`

- **TOURISTS BECOME REAL: THE FERRY, THE VISITORS AND THE DRIFTWOOD HOTEL**
  (Matt's directive, built 2026-08-19, worktree — verbatim: *"tourists become
  real; real money, come in on a cruise ship with status bars in various
  conditions, disembark, stay for a day or two. New business is hotel, run by
  an NPC (tho we should have a mechanism for owning it)"*, plus the correction
  he issued a minute later: *"say ferry, forget about cruise ships"*.)

  **THE FAULT.** A tourist blinked into existence beside a queue on a
  reputation-paced timer, waited, ate, and walked off the right-hand edge of
  the world. There was no such person: `spawnEvery` WAS the demand curve,
  wearing a name for four characters' worth of queue label. Everything else in
  this town is a population — crabs with wallets, needs, homes and opinions —
  and the thing paying all the bills was a clock.

  **DEMAND IS A POPULATION NOW.** Visitors land in BATCHES off the ferry, walk
  down the pier into town, and stay a day or two. They carry a WALLET of real
  money and spend it down; when it is gone they stop buying, and whatever they
  did not spend goes home in their pocket. They carry the same five NEEDS every
  crab carries, in various conditions off the boat, and those needs are what
  sends them to a counter — a ferry-load of hungry, filthy visitors is a good
  day for the shack and for SUDSY. At night they need somewhere to sleep, which
  is what the hotel is for.

  **A VISITOR IS A CUSTOMER OBJECT THAT PERSISTS.** That is the whole trick and
  it is why the diff is small: the queue, patience, seating, table service,
  tipping, busing, the reserved local slot, click-to-follow and the tourist
  dossier all already operate on customer objects, so a VISIT is a longer life
  with the shop pipeline as its sub-machine. `k.visitor` marks them; the states
  in `VIS_STATES` (ashore / roam / toBiz / toRoom / inRoom / onSand / toPier)
  are theirs; every state the counter owns is untouched.

  **THE MONEY NEVER INFLATES.** A wallet is minted when the ferry lands and
  destroyed when it sails; between those two moments the only thing that
  happens to it is `creditBiz`. Add to the OWNERS block's audit:
  `visitor wallets (ferry in) -> outside money IN, only as spent` and
  `unspent wallets (ferry out) -> DESTROYED, exactly like rent`.

  ### The arrival model, and its numbers
  `FERRY_TIMES` **8:00 / 10:30 / 13:00 / 15:30**, `FERRY_STAY` 75 game-minutes
  alongside, batch `FERRY_BASE 2.0 + rep x FERRY_REP 0.013` scaled by
  `FERRY_LOAD [1.2, 1.1, 0.9, 0.8]`. `window.onFerry(kind)` is the SEAM for the
  agent building the island's horizon and the run to the mainland — everything
  this system needs is two events, `ferryDock()` and `ferryGo()`, and anything
  richer should call those and delete `FERRY_TIMES`.

  **FOUR SAILINGS, NOT TWO, AND THAT IS MEASURED.** A boat is a BURST where the
  spawn timer was a trickle, and this town is short of TABLES: with two big
  sailings the whole boat hit one counter at once, every table was taken by the
  third guest, and the rest were handed a plate over the pass. The SEATED share
  fell **88% -> 61%** and with it the **$9 table tip**, which is most of a
  guest's value. Four smaller boats put the same people through the same dining
  room and the share comes back (10.9 seatings a day against the pre-pass
  build's 11.1). `VIS_PATIENCE` went **50 -> 100** for the same reason: somebody
  who crossed on a boat to be here waits longer than a passer-by, and at 50 the
  burst cost two seated guests a day their table tip.

  | measured, 6 solvent towns x 14d | value |
  |---|---|
  | sailings a day | 4 |
  | visitors per sailing | 3.0 (2-4, by reputation) |
  | arrivals a day | 12.0 |
  | average stay | **25.9 hours** |
  | average spend | **$29.19** of an ~$85 purse |
  | ...left unspent, going home | $53.27 |
  | purchases per visitor | 1.57 |
  | tourist serves a day, town-wide | 19.5 |
  | rage-quits a day | 3.1 (pre-pass build: 3.4) |

  **THE UNSPENT HALF IS THE POINT, not a leak.** Visitors are not
  wallet-limited; they are QUEUE-limited. Instrumented over six days, the
  commonest reason `visPick` hands back nothing is `|full` — the shack's line
  already holds its four tourists. The town is leaving half of every purse on
  the table because a two-crab shack cannot serve it, and that is exactly the
  incentive the growth strategy is supposed to feel.

  ### The hotel as data
  `BIZ.hotel` — DRIFTWOOD HOTEL, x2200-2428 past the last beach cottage, rent
  **$35**, owner **REEF** (a new `OWNERS` entry and a new founding NPC), hours
  **10:00-22:00**, wage `WAGE_STD`, `autoLabor` on like any peer owner. Its
  "dish" is A NIGHT'S STAY: the linen press makes up a room, the front desk
  hands over the key at **$13**, and the guest walks to a door on the back wall.
  - **THE ROOMS ARE `stalls` ON PURPOSE.** Every wedge guard, cleaning dispatch
    and abort path in this game already knows what to do with a facility a
    guest OCCUPIES and staff must CLEAN afterwards — it is the shower stalls'
    cycle with a longer occupancy. `lodging: true` is the one bit that says
    "the guest keeps this until morning" instead of "for showerT seconds".
    Seven rooms; a let room goes DIRTY at 07:30 checkout and housekeeping turns
    it, so a badly-staffed hotel loses rooms to its own laundry.
  - **CHECKING IN IS NOT GOING TO BED.** They take the key in the afternoon and
    go back out with a bed waiting — which is what makes the room worth its $13:
    an evening in town instead of a walk to the last boat.
  - **A BED IS RANKED BELOW EVERYTHING** until `ROOM_HOUR` (15:00), when it
    outranks geography outright. Measured with the room above a meal: a visitor
    came off the boat, walked the length of the promenade to drop a bag, and had
    half a day left to spend — the shack's peak till fell **$70** and the growth
    town could no longer afford its first chef.
  - **REEF LIVES IN THE COTTAGE NEXT DOOR** (lot 8). An owner-operator
    commuting to the far east end from the shelter would spend a ten-hour day on
    the road; founders differ in the stuff they start with, exactly as SUDSY
    opens with a shop and a $200 till.
  - Measured: **4.8 room-lets a night against seven rooms (69% occupancy)**,
    **~$63 a night** of room money plus tips against the $35 lease.

  ### The mechanism for owning it
  The failure path already let the player take on a SHUTTERED shop. `sellable`
  on a BIZ adds the other half: a trading shop whose owner would sell grows an
  **OFFER $N** chip on its shopfront, in the slot the MANAGE chip occupies on a
  shop you already own, on the same two-tap arm the FOR SALE chip uses. It is
  the SAME PATH, not a second one — `buyOutOwner` lists the shop (laying the
  owner and staff off, killing his postings) at `offerPrice = askingPrice x
  OFFER_MULT 1.5`, then runs the ordinary player purchase. The one thing it adds
  is that somebody is on the other side of the deal: **the seller banks exactly
  what leaves the player's pocket**, and walks down to the pier a rich crab.
  Priced around **$570-700** in a trading town — CLAWCADE territory, i.e. a
  mid-game decision rather than a lottery. The bankruptcy path still works too:
  a hotel that misses three settlements shutters and goes on the market at the
  ordinary asking price.

  ### The unhoused answer, and why it is an ENVIRONMENT answer
  A visitor with nowhere to sleep does not misbehave — they bed down on the
  sand, and **the sand banks no rest**, which is the rule `sleepRough()` already
  applies to crabs. Every consequence falls out of that one fact: they wake
  tired and grubby, they take the **next boat** instead of a second night, and
  they cost the town **-1.2 reputation** on the way out (a served guest is
  +0.4/+0.8, so this is small and one-sided on purpose). Nothing is scripted.
  The fix is to have rooms free — which is a staffing, housekeeping and
  ownership problem the player can actually solve, and which the player feels
  directly the moment they own the hotel and a full house is lost revenue.
  Measured: **3.2 unhoused a night against 4.8 let**, i.e. **25% of departing
  visitors slept out at least once**, and the nights it happens are the nights
  the hotel is BADLY RUN (the keeper's rest day, housekeeping behind, the shop
  gone dark) rather than a standing fact about the town.

  ### Four faults found by watching rather than measuring
  1. **`OFF_BASE` had no row for the hotel**, so it fell through to base 0 —
     MONDAY — and day 1 is a Monday. REEF took the town's opening day off, the
     Driftwood stood unstaffed 07:00 to midnight, and every overnighter off the
     first day's boats slept on the sand. **`juicebar` is still missing the same
     row** — a pre-existing fault of the same shape, left alone because fixing
     it moves the measured juice-bar curves and this pass has enough numbers of
     its own. Worth one line in a quiet pass.
  2. A guest called to the boat straight out of bed never CHECKED OUT, so the
     night was never credited and the room went back dirty uncounted.
  3. The departure call was a flat 165 game-minutes, so a guest with a room
     200px from the pier was checking out at **05:15** for an 08:00 boat. It is
     now sized per visitor off the walk they actually face.
  4. Visitors came off the plank at boardwalk height and rose to the rail.
  5. **The town opens at 07:00, which is on the wrong side of `WAKE_HOUR`**, so
     the boat-load a new town starts with was filed as SLEEPING ROUGH for the
     first half hour of the game — and docked the town a point of reputation
     each for a bed nobody could have sold them yet. A visitor now only beds
     down on the sand at actual bedtime. (Honest note: that accident was worth
     about two escapes in sixteen growth seeds, because a rough-slept visitor
     takes the next boat and the seeded crowd was therefore staying longer. The
     bug is still a bug; the opening crowd was widened by two to pay for it.)

  ### A THIRD FISHER, and why the hotel needed one
  The job board lets a flush NPC owner hire a jobless fisher, and with a SECOND
  peer owner in town **both** of the founding pair were signed on the same
  morning: measured on seed 1337, SALTY went to the hotel and DRIFT to the
  showers on day 4, the pier landed **ZERO** fish for the rest of the run, and
  the shack was buying $7 import fish from day nine — about **$30 a day** at
  exactly the wrong moment. The price mechanism does correct it (a $7 ceiling
  posts HELP WANTED: THE PIER and a drifter answers) but it corrects a week
  late, which is the whole do-nothing window. A town with a hotel, twice the
  visitors and twice the appetite supports three fishers, so it has three —
  **KELP**, on the rail's third spot — and the labour market has slack. After:
  the pier holds all three, the price sits at $2-4, landings run 9-22/day.

  ### Balance
  Measured on this tree, before -> after:

  | matrix | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16` | 0/16, median **10** | **0/16, median 11** (6,8,9,9,10,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,13,13,14,15) |
  | growth `--buy chef,table` 40d x 8 | **4/8** | **2/8** (6,8,9,10,14,15,41,41) |
  | growth, second block `--seedbase 8` | **2/8** | **3/8** (11,11,12,15,17,41,41,41) |
  | growth, both blocks (16 seeds) | **6/16** | **5/16** |

  **The 8-seed growth block is a COIN, and that is the finding to carry
  forward**: the same pre-pass build reads 4/8 on the default seeds and 2/8 on
  `--seedbase 8`. Across sixteen growth seeds the curve moves by ONE town, which
  is the honest reading and the reason the second block was run at all.
  Lose-by-default is absolute (0/16) and the median sits inside CLAUDE.md's
  documented 11-13 band. Propped 6-town probe (the demand, isolated from the
  eviction): player takings **$300.4/day -> $299.3/day**, seatings 11.1 -> 10.9,
  rage 3.43 -> 3.33, SUDSY's showers **4.3 -> 5.4 guests a day** and she keeps
  her shop in 3 towns of 6 against 4 of 6 (a wash, and she is BUSIER).

  **What was tuned, and it was all my own knobs** (never a price, a wage or a
  rent that existed before this pass): the sailing timetable, the batch curve,
  visitor need rates, `VIS_PATIENCE`, the purse, `ROOM_RATE`/the hotel's lease,
  `ROOM_RANK`, and the hotel's opening float.

  ### Suite 116 -> 122
  New: `ferry: a batch lands, walks down the pier, and reaches the town`;
  `visitors: the wallet is real money, and it runs out`; `visitors: a guest
  stays the night and leaves on a later ferry (and roundtrips save/load)`;
  `hotel: it lets rooms, takes the money, and the player can buy it`; `hotel: a
  full house is handled sanely - nobody wedges, nobody vanishes`; `visitors: the
  reserved local slot still feeds the neighbours`. They go red on the pre-pass
  build with a ReferenceError rather than a behavioural failure — honest but
  weaker, and noted as such, because the entities they test do not exist there.

  **Re-pointings (13, every one with its receipt written into the scenario):**
  1. `hours: defaults are behavior-identical (frozen day-2 fingerprint)` —
     re-baselined. It could not possibly have survived: the pass replaces the
     entire demand model AND adds two founders, so even the SHAPE of the
     fingerprint changes. Drift reads like the change it is (serves 35 -> 50 and
     33 -> 57 town-wide, SUDSY's till up on both seeds, the player's till down
     on one and up on the other).
  2. `hours: shortened hours really close the shop` — the MEASURE, twice.
     ADMISSIONS counted anybody in the line, "arriving" OR "waiting", so the
     tail of a legitimate pre-close queue (visitors are more patient now) read
     as six admissions after close; an admission is a crab WALKING INTO the
     line. And duty is sampled from close+90 rather than close+60, because a
     crab who was mid-plate at the last-call bell finishes it, stands idle for a
     frame and walks home.
  3. `taps: free and always reachable, and the juice bar still sells` — the
     floor was calibrated against the retired spawn timer, which sent a fixed
     ~27% of a much faster stream to the bar. Drinks are bought because a
     visitor is THIRSTY now, so the bar's trade is a share of a real population:
     $789/$886/$851/$868 over 4 seeds x 14d. Floor re-measured, AND the property
     the gate exists for is now asserted directly — the bar's trade is mostly
     TOURISTS, and tourists do not use taps.
  4. `housing: npcs sleep at the shelter, then move up` — REEF excluded; a
     starting ASSET, like SUDSY's shop and till.
  5. `all 9 lots stand` — the founders are three now, and REEF opens in cottage
     8. The rule under test (hiring never conjures a house) is unchanged.
  6. `save/load: townsfolk keep wallets and houses` — reached for `npcs[1]` and
     meant SALTY; the townsfolk list grew. Named lookup, and a free lot.
  7. `tired: a workday accrues it; sleep drains it, bed beating cot` — the
     fixture pinned the RUNG but not the BED; a busier evening left the crew
     crab still walking home at 21:30 and it was measuring the commute.
  8. `hiring with no tourists books a morning-bus arrival` — a town is no longer
     EMPTY before it opens (`seedVisitors`), so the fixture sends them home
     rather than asserting they were never there.
  9. `wage: the shipped defaults are behaviour-identical` — one more row in the
     opening-rates roster. The hotel opens on WAGE_STD.
  10. `mortality: a dead townsfolk crab leaves the town in a sane state` — two
     receipts. "Still dark on reload" was only ever true by poverty (succession
     can now clear the market); and DRIFT, on SUDS SHOWERS' opening $20 in a $23
     town, was POACHED by the Driftwood at 20:00 on the night she died, because
     `runWageRelations` runs earlier in the same settlement than the illness
     roll.
  11. `staff meals` (both) — they waited for `customers.length === 0`, and a
     visitor never leaves that list. Asked as "nobody is mid-order" instead.
  12. `npc shops run the same policy: SUDSY takes a sick day` — the fixture is
     about a SINGLE-WORKER shop hanging its own placard and never made sure the
     shop had one worker. Ferry traffic keeps her till healthier, so the job
     board signs her an attendant on day 2 and the shop correctly stops resting
     when she does. Her roster is now held at one.
  13. `visitors: the reserved local slot still feeds the neighbours` (one of the
     new six, re-pointed before it shipped, and the control is the interesting
     part): the "nobody is left pinned at hunger" bar is a SHARE of the town,
     not a flat count, because SUDSY sits at 1.00 on day 4 of the PRE-PASS build
     too, on every seed measured — the lone attendant reaching the shack's
     evening queue is a named open trap in this file and not this pass's doing.
     What the gate proves positively is the other half: the same four days serve
     locals 10-12 times against the pre-pass build's 7-8.

  ### Story beat (organic, browser — ROE, two days at the Driftwood)
  Open her record and the whole visit is on one card. **ROE** came over on an
  earlier ferry at **07:00** with **$158** and a purple shell. She ate a FISH
  TACO at the shack at **10:37** ($17), had a DELUXE SOAK at SUDS SHOWERS at
  **11:54** ($10), took **ROOM 5 AT THE DRIFTWOOD** at **16:19**, went back out
  and had a second soak at **18:39**, and at 20:35 she is out on the promenade
  reading **STARVING - STROLLING THE PROMENADE**, **$78 LEFT OF THE $158 THEY
  BROUGHT**, **$80 SPENT IN TOWN OVER 4 VISITS**, **SAILS HOME IN 35H**. She is
  the sentence the directive asked for: that's ROE, she's been here since this
  morning, she's in room 5, and she is about to want her dinner.
  Shot: `visitor-dossier`.

  ### Story beat (organic, browser — day 2 of a full house)
  Six guests, seven rooms, and you can read every one of their days off the
  dossier. **PEARL** came ashore on the 08:00 boat with $97. She had a DELUXE
  SOAK at SUDS SHOWERS at 10:08, checked into **room 2** at 13:41, ate a FISH
  TACO at the shack at 17:17, went back to the showers at 19:40 and **gave up
  waiting** — the evening queue — turned in at 23:14, and sailed home the next
  morning having spent **$57 of her $97**. **PLANKTON PETE**, off the same boat
  with $80, checked into room 1 before lunch and did it the other way round:
  soak at 13:45, grilled fish at 18:26, bed at 21:35, $52 spent. **BIG PALP**
  landed with $104, ate at 14:31, took room 5 at 17:36, and bought a juice at
  20:33 on his way back to it. And **MISTY**, two nights booked, four purchases
  in and still in room 1 — got hired. The SHOP's recruitment path prefers a
  visitor who is in town right now, so the guest you had been watching for two
  days put on an apron and joined the crew, keeping her name and her shell.

- **THE CRAB DIARY — a per-crab activity log, and the record that shows it**
  (Matt's directive, built 2026-08-19, worktree: *"We need a detail view of
  the character where we can see all of their recent actions, because that is
  awesome."* Plus two owner additions mid-build: *"should also keep track of
  housing status carefully"* and *"there should be a button in the detail view
  to follow that crab too."*)
  - **ONE API, ONE LINE PER HOOK.** `crabLog(crab, category, line[, gapMins])`
    appends to `c.p.log`, a ring buffer of `LOG_MAX` **40** entries stored as
    `[day, minute, category, line]` ARRAYS (~46 bytes an entry; the same fields
    keyed would cost ~40% more). `crabLogEvery(crab, slot, mins, cat, line)` is
    the door for a whole CLASS of line that would otherwise spam — a chef's
    plates all read differently, so text-dedup cannot catch them. Categories
    (and their colours): **work / money / home / need / life / peril /
    social** — `social` is deliberately empty and reserved for the
    boredom-and-chatting build landing beside this one, so those behaviours
    are literally one line each after the merge.
  - **THE RULE OF THUMB, enforced by the suite**: an entry is something a
    player would tell a friend about. "SERVED A FISH TACO TO MISTY", never
    "state changed to errand". Every hook sits at an event that already
    happens once; repetitive events carry a minimum gap in GAME MINUTES —
    serves 25min (a rush hour reads as a few named plates), clock-in 720min
    (a fisher who breaks for lunch walks back to the rail three times and only
    the first is news), house rent 600min, stall scrubs 90min. A fishing day
    is TALLIED and filed as ONE line at dusk ("LANDED 9 FISH OFF THE PIER");
    only THE BIG ONE gets its own entry.
  - **What is logged**: clock in / shift end (+ OT hours) / named serves /
    stall scrubs; wages drawn, unpaid nights, house rent, a business bought;
    meals, drinks (bought vs the free tap), showers, standpipe rinses, beach
    roasts, staff meals; going to bed hungry / parched / filthy / dead on
    their feet (a THRESHOLD at settlement, never a tick); falling ill with the
    reason, laid-up days, recovery, gravely ill, and death as the last entry;
    hired off the bus or converted from a tourist, job-board hires, quitting
    when the till is empty, layoffs (an owner-operator's reads "LOST THE SUDS
    SHOWERS - SHUTTERS UP"), day off, sick day, mastery and fishing tiers, and
    giving up on a queue. **Deliberately NOT logged**: taking a station per
    dish (fires several times per plate — the exact tick-level trace the rule
    forbids; the shift's clock-in carries the workplace instead) and anything
    else per-tick.
  - **HOUSING IS THE SPINE** (the owner's addition). Every move is a first-
    class `home` entry that NAMES the place and what it cost — "MOVED INTO
    HOUSE 3 - $35", "MOVED ABOARD THE PEARL - $75", "MOVED TO A BEACH COTTAGE
    - CLOSER TO WORK", "TOOK A COT AT THE SHELTER" (the first night of a
    spell, never the twentieth), and the one that turns a run,
    **"COULDN'T MAKE RENT - LOST THE HOUSE"**. The diary page also carries a
    compact history that survives the buffer rolling over: a **trail**
    (`p.homeTrail`, last 4 addresses, "SHELTER > HOUSE 5 > COTTAGE") and a
    **nights tally** (`p.nHome` / `p.nCot`, red when the cots are winning) with
    "HERE SINCE D12". You can open a crab and see whether the life is going up
    or down without reading a line.
  - **THE VIEW** — the dossier grew a page, not a new screen. A bottom control
    bar (PROFILE | DIARY n | FOLLOW | CLOSE, 13px chips) on the same
    ONE-geometry-table idiom as `manageRects`: `dossierRects(h)` feeds both the
    draw and the hit-test, so tap targets can't drift from pixels. The card
    lives in rows 0..PANEL_Y, which is the world area in BOTH canvas modes, so
    240 and 288 get the identical record (shot in both). The DIARY page:
    housing banner, then the timeline newest-first, 12 rows a page, coloured by
    category, `<` `>` paging. Reached from the follow card, the crew cards and
    the census row — the same three doors the dossier always had.
  - **FOLLOW** (the owner's second addition): selection and camera are
    deliberately separate in this game, so the button sets BOTH (`followCrab`
    → `sel` + `followIdx`/`followNpc`/`followCust`) and closes the record —
    and the management card under it — so you can actually watch them. It
    reads **FOLLOWING**, dimmed, when the camera is already on that crab, and
    it works for a tourist too (they are customer objects, not crabs).
    Verified in the browser: FOLLOW from a census-reached record leaves
    `sel`/`followNpc` on that crab and `camX` converges to exactly
    `crab.x - W/2 + 8`.
  - **The price of the page**: the profile's five stacked need bars became ONE
    row of five (the follow card's idiom) to pay for the 18px control bar —
    same numbers, shorter meters — and CLAIMS TO FAME steps aside on the one
    crab that can't fit it (gravely ill + resting + PACE + WALK all at once).
  - **Measured — save**: a 9-crab town, day 13, every founder's buffer full:
    **5,169 B → 18,587 B (+13,418)**. 12,730 of that is diary, 46.1 B an entry.
    It is bounded by construction (crabs x 40 x ~46B): a maxed 14-crab town is
    ~26 KB a slot, ~130 KB across all five, against localStorage's ~5 MB. Old
    saves carry no log and start writing one; `clampLog` filters junk and
    re-caps on load, on both the crew and the townsfolk paths.
  - **Measured — perf**: it writes on events, never per tick. 3 seeds x 20
    days, before vs after, two runs each: **11.23s / 11.59s before, 11.53s /
    11.47s after** — 26.0-26.8 us/frame in both arms, i.e. inside run-to-run
    noise. The only per-tick addition anywhere is one `c.logOff !== day`
    comparison for the day-off line.
  - **BEHAVIOUR-NEUTRAL, and the tripwire agrees**: no RNG, no sim state read
    back, nothing but bookkeeping. `hours: defaults are behavior-identical
    (frozen day-2 fingerprint)` passes **UNTOUCHED - no re-baseline**, and so
    does every other existing scenario. **Suite 102 -> 107**, five new:
    `diary: a day in a full town reads as a life, not a trace` (all three kinds
    of crab, categories present, no duplicate inside its window, no day over 26
    entries, one catch line a day, every line inside the card's 39 columns),
    `diary: it roundtrips save/load and stays bounded over many days` (exact
    log + trail + tally roundtrip, bounded after the reload, and a
    diary-stripped OLD save that opens clean and starts writing), `diary: the
    last entry is the death, and the memorial still works`, `diary: the ring
    buffer never grows past its cap under a soak` (24 days, somebody must
    actually FILL it or the soak isn't testing anything, entries stay ordered),
    and `diary: housing is the spine - every move is written down by name`.
  - **Story beat (organic, seed 11, browser)**: SHELLDON's page, day 17.
    "D16 09:30 TOOK THEIR DAY OFF / D16 13:54 TOOK A SHOWER AT THE SUDS SHOWERS
    / **D16 20:00 COULDN'T MAKE RENT - LOST THE HOUSE** / D17 07:09 CLOCKED IN
    AT THE CRAB SHACK" and then eight named plates through to 16:30 — a crab
    who lost his house on his day off and worked a full shift the next morning,
    with the housing banner over it reading "SHELTER > HOUSE 3 > SHELTER, 10
    NIGHTS HOUSED, 6 ON A COT". Shots: `diary-crew`, `diary-crew-tall`,
    `diary-sudsy`, `diary-sudsy-tall`, `diary-from-census`,
    `diary-follow-from-record`, `diary-profile-tabs`, `diary-profile-crowded`
    under shots/.
- **THE WAGE IS A SETTING** (built 2026-08-19, worktree — Matt: *"I think
  giving bosses the ability to adjust wages is the next step here.. if we don't
  have it already.. need a menu setting"*, plus the amendment *"Should be able
  to pay workers different amounts though, even though it's a pain"*). Wages
  were two frozen constants; they are now three layers, most specific winning:

  | layer | what it is | default |
  |---|---|---|
  | `WAGE_STD` | the town's standard day | **23** (the old CRAB_WAGE) |
  | `BIZ[b].wage` | what THIS shop advertises and pays | WAGE_STD |
  | `p.wage` | what THIS crab negotiated | the shop's rate |

  `wageRate()` reads them in that order and **every pay path in the game
  already ran through it** — `basePayToday`, `contractPay`, `hourlyRate`,
  `otPremium` — so the settlement, the BILL chip, the MENU column and the
  bankruptcy forecaster total per-crab rates without one of them learning a
  new rule. Bounds `WAGE_MIN 8` / `WAGE_MAX 60`, $1 steps, `clampWage` on
  every setter and on load.
  - **`NPC_WAGE` IS RETIRED** and PLAN's deferred wage asymmetry with it. A
    business pays what it pays, whoever works there. The 20 survives in
    exactly one place — **SUDS SHOWERS' OPENING rate**, a fact about her shop
    rather than about the crabs in it — and that is deliberate: it is inert
    against the shipped curves, it gives the new lever something to bite on
    in a default town, and *her own wage policy corrects it in public*.
    (Measured: forcing every shop to 23 instead moves nothing systematic —
    a 6-town propped matrix reads 18/21/17/27/21 infections at showers-wage
    20/21/22/23/24, i.e. **non-monotone stream chaos**, so this is a design
    choice with a receipt, not a balance dodge.)
  - **A PRIVATE DEAL IS A DEAL WITH A BOSS** (`p.wageOwner`). It travels with
    the crab across every shop that owner runs — reassign crew from the shack
    to the juice bar and the deal comes too — and **lapses, announced in the
    day report, the moment somebody else signs the cheque**. The alternative
    would let a $50 crew crab wander onto SUDSY's payroll with a deal she
    never made.
  - **THE MENU SETTING** lives on the management screen's SCHEDULE tab, beside
    the roster it belongs to. A shop-rate stepper with big 16x15 targets, an
    **ALL $N** chip that tears up every private deal in one tap (the bulk
    action that makes per-crab bearable), **TONIGHT $N** — the exact payroll,
    live, as you step — and **TOWN $N / PIER $N**, what the rest of the market
    is paying. Every roster row gains a `- $23 +` stepper, the number
    highlighted orange when it is a private deal, and the name goes red when
    that crab is one warning from the door. Both canvas modes (the card is
    H-independent geometry); every control driven through the real click path.
  - **CONSEQUENCES — a crab measures its pay against three offers it could
    actually take**, and under all three sits **the town's standard day**:
    - **THE WATER** — `FISH_DAY (5)` fish at today's floating market price,
      discounted by `PIER_TOUGH 0.6` because a paycheck is steady and the
      water is not. This is the same figure the job board already used.
    - **NEXT DOOR** — the *mean* rate of the other shops hiring in town (mean,
      not max, so one rich shop cannot drag everyone's demands up).
    - **THE CRAB AT THE NEXT STATION** — the best-paid other staffer at their
      own shop, at `PEER_TOL 0.85`. The sharp one, and the one Matt asked for.
    - **`WAGE_STD x KEEP (1.0)`, the floor no boss can argue down.** MEASURED
      FAULT and the reason it exists: without it, cutting every shop to $20
      moved the going rate down too — *the player IS most of the town's
      payroll* — so the cut was free and **2 of 16 do-nothing towns survived
      30 days** against a pillar of 0. "Cut the wage on day one" would have
      been the obviously correct opening move and the whole lever a fake
      stepper. Inert by construction: the ratio at WAGE_STD is exactly 1.0.
    - Grievance (`p.gripe`) accrues nightly at `GAIN 1.0 x shortfall` after a
      `GRACE` of 2 nights on a new job, and is shed at `CALM 0.34` — much
      faster when the fix is generous (`MAKEUP 3`), so a player who puts it
      right sees the crab back on the clock the next morning rather than
      sulking through a week they already paid for. Capped at 1.3.
    - **WARNINGS FIRST, ALWAYS**: a grumbling quip + a dossier line at 0.35, a
      **named toast** at 0.70 ("SCUTTLE IS ASKING AROUND - $17 ISN'T ENOUGH"),
      a `SORE ABOUT PAY` mood, a red name on the roster. Only then feet.
    - **NPC staff QUIT** at 1.0 — poached by a better-paying vacancy if one
      exists (`poachTarget`), else back to the pier down the existing quit
      path. **CREW DO NOT RESIGN**: they are under contract with the player,
      the same reasoning that keeps them out of the pool of crabs who can buy
      a failed business. They **WALK OUT** — refusing tomorrow's shift, unpaid
      — decided at settlement so there is a whole evening to fix it, and
      repeated nightly until it is fixed. Routed through `offToday`, so the
      wage skip, the BILL dip, the placard and errands-all-day all come free,
      while `coveringToday` (which reads the ROTA) correctly refuses to hand
      the shop a free cover double for it. **Never an unrecoverable state.**
    - **A crab paid above the going rate cannot be poached, by construction** —
      grievance is the only thing that turns a head, and the best-paid crab in
      the room has none.
    - **HIGH pay buys labour**: postings advertise the shop's own rate (and the
      card now prints what a day on the pier pays beside it); the player's SHOP
      hire answers the same comparison (`recruitBites`, inert at defaults
      because the pier's best claim is 7 x 5 x 0.6 = $21 under WAGE_STD 23).
  - **CPU OWNERS RUN THE SAME LEVER** (`WAGE_POLICY` + `runWagePolicy`, the
    `HOURS_POLICY` pattern): RAISE +$1 on an unfillable post, an aggrieved
    staffer, or a loss to pay in the last 3 days; TRIM -$1 when fully staffed,
    nobody aggrieved, and paying over `trimOver 1.12` of the market. One move
    a day, a cooldown day, a named toast. **Deliberately SHOP-LEVEL** — a peer
    owner sets one rate and never negotiates per crab; the player having the
    finer instrument is a fair asymmetry, the same shape as right-click orders.
    Converges because the regimes are disjoint with a dead band between them
    and every raise weakens its own trigger (suite-proved over 30 days: no two
    moves in a day, never two days running, nothing moving in the last week).
  - **THE SWEEP, and the verdict.** `--wage N` and `--star N` were added to
    `tools/headless.mjs` (both through the game's own setters).

    | growth, `--buy chef,table` 40d x 8 | alive | evictions | median | lifetime | crew housed | walkouts |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | **$17** (-25%) | 0/8 | 10-17 | 14 | $35,757 | **0/29** | 154 |
    | **$20** | 0/8 | 14-20 | 18 | $47,958 | 1/35 | 216 |
    | **$23** (default) | **6/8** | 11,14,41x6 | **41** | **$133,121** | **38/40** | 0 |
    | **$26** | 1/8 | 9-41 | 11 | $46,495 | 20/20 | 0 |
    | **$29** (+25%) | 0/8 | 9-14 | 10 | $27,631 | 16/16 | 0 |
    | **$35** (+50%) | 0/8 | 7-10 | 8 | $22,312 | 16/16 | 0 |

    Replicated on a second seed block (`--seedbase 8`): $23 3/8 median 13
    ($83k), $26 1/8 median 12 ($49k), $20 0/8 median 19 ($47k) — same
    direction both times, so the effect is not knife-edge chaos.

    | baseline, 30d x 16 | survive | median | lifetime | crew housed | walkouts |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | **$17** | 0/16 | 8 | $32,273 | **0/32** | 96 |
    | **$20** | 0/16 | 12 | $53,724 | **0/32** | 84 |
    | **$23** (default) | **0/16** | **14** | $71,500 | 18/32 | 0 |
    | **$26** | 0/16 | 12 | $68,992 | **32/32** | 0 |
    | **$29** | 0/16 | 10 | $57,159 | **32/32** | 0 |

    **THE HOUSING LADDER IS THE CLEANEST SIGNAL IN THE GAME**: crew housed at
    day 30 runs **0/32 → 0/32 → 18/32 → 32/32 → 32/32** across $17→$29. The
    wage reaches the wallet and the wallet is the ladder, exactly as specced.
    - **IS THERE AN OBVIOUSLY CORRECT WAGE? Yes, and it is the default — but
      the lever is still real, because it is a REAL TRADE-OFF and not a free
      saving in either direction.** Down: you buy runway and lose the town
      (at $20 the growth median eviction *lengthens* to 18-19 days while
      escape goes to 0/8, lifetime halves, and the crew never leave the cots).
      Up: you house everybody, nobody ever walks, and the rent eats you. The
      honest statement for Matt is that **$23 is the balanced point of an
      economy that was tuned around $23**, so the interesting play is not
      "what number is best" but "what do I do when the market moves" — the
      fish price at the ceiling, a peer owner bidding, a shop bought off the
      market with its staff on somebody else's rate. That is where the lever
      earns its keep, and it is why the pier comparison floats.
    - **DOES PAYING ONE CRAB MORE EVER BEAT RAISING EVERYONE? No.** At equal
      payroll cost (+$6/night on two crew, 16 seeds x 30d): uniform $26 reads
      median 12, **$68,992** lifetime, **32/32** crew housed; one star on $29
      reads median 12, **$62,907**, **23/32** housed. Same survival, 10% less
      money, worse housing. Said plainly: **per-crab is an instrument for
      SITUATIONS, not a strategy** — keeping one attendant when you have just
      bought a shop whose whole roster is on somebody else's $20, or holding a
      crab a peer owner is bidding for — and the bulk **ALL $N** action is
      there because most days you want one number.
      (En route this was measured much worse: at full peer weight one crab on
      $35 made **every** colleague demand $35 and growth collapsed to a median
      eviction of day **7**. `PEER_TOL 0.85` is what makes a premium of about
      a sixth pass unremarked.)
  - **DEFAULTS ARE INERT, three receipts.** (1) The frozen day-2 fingerprint
    passes **untouched** — no re-baseline. (2) `--days 30 --seeds 16` reads
    **0/16, 11,12,13,13,13,13,13,14,14,14,14,14,14,14,14,20, median 14** and
    `--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` reads **6/8, 11,14,41,41,41,41,41,41**
    — both **byte-identical to the lists already in this file**. (3) With the
    relations layer off (`window._noWageRelations`/`_noWagePolicy`) the propped
    6-town matrix reproduces the pre-pass build exactly (6 deaths, 18
    infections), i.e. the grievance machinery contributes literally nothing
    until somebody moves a stepper.
  - **Suite 102 → 109, ZERO re-pointing.** New: defaults are behaviour-identical
    (nobody grumbles, nobody moves); the setting changes tonight's payroll
    exactly and the settlement/BILL/MENU/forecaster/OT all agree across sick
    days, days off and mixed rates; underpaying loses you staff with the
    warnings in order and the walkout reversible; an underpaid NPC quits and a
    better payer poaches them (plus the can't-poach-a-well-paid-crab arm);
    overpaying wins a hire the standard rate could not, weighed against the
    fish price, on both the job board and the player's own SHOP hire; the CPU
    policy converges and never thrashes; and every rate, deal, grievance and
    scheduled walkout roundtrips save/load including a change of boss, APPLY
    TO ALL, and a degenerate save clamping into the band.
  - **Story beat (organic, reproducible)**: `node tools/headless.mjs --buy
    chef,table --days 40 --seeds 1 --seedbase 5` (seed 8022). SUDS SHOWERS
    opens at **$20** in a **$23** town. SUDSY hires **SALTY** off the rail; he
    grumbles, then starts asking around. **Day 12** she raises to $21 — and it
    is too late: **day 15 SALTY quits over the pay and goes back to the pier.**
    She raises again on day 14, 16 and 18, to **$24**, and there she stops for
    the remaining 22 days. The town's last wage asymmetry was not legislated
    away; **SUDSY fixed it herself, in public, after it cost her a hand.**
    Shots: `wage-schedule-tab`, `wage-schedule-portrait`,
    `sudsy-raises-the-wage`, `jobboard-wage-posting`, `wage-dossier-pay-row`
    under shots/.
  - **Left for the diary agent**: every wage moment is a single obvious call
    site marked `// DIARY HOOK:` — the player moving a rate, a deal lapsing,
    the first grumble, the warning, a walkout, a quit, a poach, and a peer
    owner's move.
- **THE TABLE SERVICE ECONOMY** (Matt's four directives, built 2026-08-19,
  worktree — verbatim: *"Decrease or eliminate tips on counter service it
  makes tables pointless; also make a setting for tip sharing (slider). Also
  increase table max, and add table cleanup"*). Also closes backlog item 6,
  "staff-bused table service for a fancier restaurant tier".

  **1. TIPS BELONG TO TABLE SERVICE.** The owner was right, and it measured
  WORSE than he thought: under the old rule a counter guest tipped **$3.24**
  and a seated guest **$2.67** (8 seeds x 30d), because a counter guest is
  served before their patience has drained while a seated one watches it drain
  at the table. The counter was literally the better tip. Now
  `TIP_COUNTER` **0.15** of the full tip for a plate handed over the pass, the
  whole tip for a seated guest — and because the pre-existing "shrapnel does
  not move the till" floor drops any tip under $0.50, the counter's *effective*
  tip measures **$0.50 a guest against the table's $2.67 plus the $9 table
  tip**. TOKEN, NOT ZERO, on purpose: the jar by the till is a real thing, a
  filthy or exhausted server can still lose it (the dirt/tiredness multipliers
  still bite), and a curve reads better than a switch. Swept 0 / 0.15 / 0.3 /
  1.0 against the do-nothing curve: **0 and 0.15 both land median 14, so the
  fraction is a design choice, not a balance lever** — a two-table town does
  most of its trade at the tables either way (1100 table serves to 400 counter
  serves over 8 seeds x 30d).

  **THE COUNTER-ONLY vs TABLED COMPARISON** (6 solvent towns x 12d, 2 crew,
  `BIZ.shack.tables = []` for the counter arm):

  | | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | counter-only, $/tourist | $15.71 | **$14.15** |
  | tabled, $/tourist | $19.90 | **$23.63** (2 tables) → **$24.60** (4) |
  | the gap | **+27%** | **+67% to +74%** |

  And the ladder is a real ladder — rung by rung, 6 towns x 12d:

  | tables | 2 crew, lifetime | 4 crew, lifetime |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0 (counter only) | $16,127 | $25,819 |
  | 2 (the start) | $23,011 | $34,126 |
  | 3 | $23,884 | $37,448 |
  | 4 | $24,580 | $37,856 |
  | 6 (the new cap) | $25,022 | **$39,805** |

  Read the two columns together and you have the whole design in one table:
  with two crabs the 5th and 6th tables are worth **+1.8%** (there is nobody
  free to bus them); with four crabs they are worth **+5.1%**, and the whole
  climb from 2 to 6 tables is +8.7% on two crew and **+16.6% on four**. Tables
  buy seats; seats need hands.

  **2. TIP SHARING — A SLIDER, AND IT MOVES THE HOUSING LADDER.**
  `BIZ[k].tipShare`, 0..1 in 5% steps, its own **PAY row group** on the
  SCHEDULE tab (a 120x12 track: tap anywhere on it, or hold and drag the
  thumb; mouse and touch; both canvas modes). `payTip()` is the ONLY place a
  tip is split, so the tip at the table and the tip in the jar mean the same
  thing, and the crab's cut lands in their **wallet**. Default **0** = how the
  till has always been paid, so an untouched town is untouched.
  Measured (6 towns x 24d, 4 crew, full table cap, tills propped so the
  slider is measured against a business rather than a deathbed):

  | share | lifetime | tips to till / to crew | mean crew wallet | crab-samples HOUSED |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **0%** | $79,216 | $37,226 / $0 | **$14.9** | **79.3%** |
  | 25% | $71,570 | $27,521 / $9,133 | $126.1 | 97.6% |
  | 50% | $62,378 | $18,286 / $18,132 | $308.4 | 98.9% |
  | **100%** | **$44,210** | $135 / $35,659 | **$687.7** | 98.9% |

  That is the trade the directive asked for, priced: **25% of the tips costs
  the till 9.7% of its lifetime takings and houses the crew** — on seed 1337
  at 0% SHELLDON is still on a shelter cot on day 24 with $26 to his name,
  and at 25% all four crew are in houses with $227-$295 banked. 100% is left
  reachable and is deliberately ruinous: the till keeps $135 of $35,794 in
  tips and the crew end on ~$1,300 each with nothing left to buy.

  **3. MORE TABLES.** `UPS.table.max` **2 → 4**: six tables, $60/90/135/203.
  The two new ones extend the BACK row west along the free wall at
  **x1444 and x1404, y134** — the only stretch of the shack that is not a
  station, a queue slot or a travel lane. Both lanes keep their daylight by
  construction (a table's solid band is y-9..y+6, so the back row has to end
  above 144 and the front row between 148 and 166) and the suite's own
  tripwire, `routes: both travel lanes are clear of every solid`, now buys all
  four rungs before it measures. Verified reachable, seatable and pathable:
  the throughput scenario seats measurably more guests at the cap, and the
  routing warp/unstick floor is unchanged.

  **4. TABLE CLEANUP — THE FANCIER TIER.** A vacated table keeps its plates
  (`dishes = 1`), goes `dirty`, and seats nobody until a staff crab clears it:
  `toTableClean` → `busingTable`, `BUS_SECS` 1.5s scaled by `crabWork x
  crabEff`, "CLEARED" on the pop, crumb-flecks on the table art, "BUSING A
  TABLE" on the follow card, and TABLES BUSED + TIPS TO THE CREW on the day
  report. Deliberately the stall pattern rather than a second one:
  `messyTable()` / `startBus()` mirror the `dirty`/`cleaning`/`toStallClean`
  trio exactly.
  - **DISPATCH was the whole difficulty, and it took three measured passes.**
    Busing only in the lull is a DEATH SPIRAL for table service: a shack with
    a queue is never idle, so the plates never got cleared and the room went
    permanently dirty (seed 99, 3 days: **47 guests seated → 8**). Busing
    from the idle loop instead made every bus a lap of the shack — crate at
    x1232, tables at x1490 — and the do-nothing town died on **day 5 instead
    of day 14**. What ships is two dispatch points and one rule:
    (a) **on the way back from a table delivery** the server is already
    standing in the dining room, so clearing the next table costs a few steps;
    (b) **in the lull**, like a stall; and (c) **turn the room** — a crab
    clears a table ahead of taking the next order, but ONLY when there is
    nowhere clean to seat that guest, and **NEVER ahead of a LOCAL**. That
    last clause is a health rule, not a nicety: letting a bus-run outrank a
    waiting neighbour took the trudge's anti-spiral gate from 6 deaths per 12
    towns to 15, because "the evening queue never reaches the local" is
    already a named trap in this town.
  - **THE PRICE WAS PAID IN TIPS, NOT IN FURNITURE.** Busing costs crew hours,
    and this economy's whole margin is its surplus, so a ~15% revenue cut
    collapses it. A **third starting table** was tried as the compensation and
    bought back exactly one day (median eviction 5 → 6) — the crew, not the
    furniture, is what busing consumes. `TABLE_BASE` therefore stays at **2**
    and the compensation is the **TABLE TIP $5 → $9**, which lands entirely on
    table service and so widens the counter/table gap instead of papering over
    it. `BUS_SECS` came down 2.5 → **1.5** in the same sweep (clearing a table
    is a swipe of the plates, not a shower-stall scrub); at 2.5 the town read
    median 14 too but the trudge gate failed at 10 deaths per 6 towns, and at
    1.5 it reads **6 deaths against 8 with the drag switched off**.
  - **WEDGE GUARDS** (the named risk, and the stall wedge is the precedent):
    `abortChef` clears `cleanTable.cleaning` — a crab who dies mid-bus would
    otherwise strand the table for the run; `abortErrand` releases a yanked
    diner's table occupant-first and flags it **dirty**, because plates on an
    unflagged table are unseatable AND unbuseable; and busing eligibility is
    `(t.dirty || t.dishes > 0)`, which makes "plates on an empty table always
    get cleared" true by construction whatever route left them there. Suite:
    `tables can never wedge` drives both abort paths and then soaks two
    trading days — worst observed out-of-service spell **60 staffed
    sim-seconds against a gate of 120**.

  **Balance.** Baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16`: **0/16, evictions
  10,10,11,11,13,13,13,13,13,14,14,15,16,16,17,19, median 13** (before 0/16,
  11-20, median 14 — one day, the documented per-build wobble).
  Growth `--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8`: **3/8 alive,
  13,13,13,14,15,41,41,41** (before 6/8, 11,14,41x6). That drop is the busing
  labour cost and it is **not** the new table rungs: `--buy chef` alone, which
  never buys a table, reads the same **3/8**. Documented rather than tuned
  away, and 3/8 is the level this project shipped at through the public-taps
  and succession passes.

  **Suite 102 → 108.** New: `tips: the counter gets a token, the table gets
  the lot` (both paths through payAndBenefit on the same guest, asserted to
  the cent), `tips: the sharing slider pays the crab's wallet and the till,
  exactly` (0 / 50 / 100% plus the clamp and the 5% snap), `tables: a vacated
  table goes dirty, blocks the room, gets bused, comes back`, `tables can
  never wedge` (both abort paths + the two-day soak), `tables: more tables
  really do seat more guests`, and `tip sharing + the table cap roundtrip
  save/load` (including an old save with no key, and a corrupt 7.5 clamped).
  **Re-pointings (3, receipts written into the scenarios):**
  1. `dining: outdoor tables, guests bus their own` → **`dining: tables are
     BUSED BY STAFF, and the room keeps turning`**. Its old assertion — no
     table ever ends a day with plates on it — WAS the outdoor rule, and the
     owner asked for that rule to go. What it is really for (the room keeps
     turning, nothing silts up) is now asserted directly: serves, seatings,
     tables bused, and no table flagged `cleaning` with nobody clearing it.
  2. `hours: defaults are behavior-identical (frozen day-2 fingerprint)` —
     re-baselined. This pass changes what a guest pays AND how a server spends
     their shift (22 tables are bused on days 1-2 alone), so day 2 could not
     survive and still be measuring anything. Receipt: on **seed 4242 every
     position is byte-identical** — all five crabs asleep in the same beds —
     and only the books move (coins 200.80 → 158.96, rep 49.37 → 50.09,
     serves 37 → 33, SUDSY's till 185.43 → 172.12). Seed 1337 moves exactly
     ONE crab, the way this fingerprint has moved twice before: DRIFT sleeps
     on a shelter cot with $23 saved instead of in cottage 8, a day behind on
     the housing ladder, and nobody is left on the boardwalk at midnight.
     Day 2 is this build's WORST day by construction — the busing bill lands
     from the first guest while the raised table tip only compounds once
     reputation brings the crowds.
  3. `staff meals: closing crew cooks their own dinner, at retail` — the
     FIXTURE. Its ledger is scoped to one meal but nothing kept a second crab
     out of the pantry while it waited, and the new stream order put CLAWDIA
     at the juicer for a drink mid-wait. Anybody already cooking is sent away
     and the others held un-peckish for the duration; the retail transaction
     under test is untouched.

  **Story beat (organic, reproducible)**: `node tools/headless.mjs --days 12
  --seeds 1` — seed 1337, no buys, no props, the town still standing on day
  13. PINCHY and CLAWDIA's two-table dining room runs at **93.7% occupancy**
  (every table either taken or waiting to be cleared) and they bus **10-13
  tables a day** — one for very nearly every guest they seat. The shack runs
  out of room exactly **14 times in twelve days**, and every single one of
  those fourteen falls between **14:04 and 15:45**: the shift-change lull,
  when there is one crab on the floor and the plates from lunch are still on
  the tables. **Day 1, 14:47: PINCHY hands SALTINE a grilled fish across the
  pass** because both tables are taken and one of them is still stacked. That
  fish earns the till its $13 and about fifty cents of tip; the guest at the
  table two feet away is worth $2.67 in tips and $9 more on the way out.
  Fourteen plates a fortnight is what the third table would have bought him.
  Shots: `tip-share-slider` (the PAY row at 35%), `tip-share-all-in` (100% —
  "THE TILL KEEPS NONE OF IT"), `busing-a-table` (SANDY at a dirty table, the
  follow card reading BUSING A TABLE), `dining-room-full` (five of the six
  tables in use at the new cap) and `day-report-tips-bused` (TIPS TO THE CREW
  $74, TABLES BUSED 13) under shots/.
- **THE FAR SHORE, THE MIST, AND THE FERRY** (the owner's world, built
  2026-08-19, worktree — verbatim: *"for the record, we are on the island of
  Crabalina, and the shore should be visible but often obscured by mist in the
  evening; but we never make this explicit; and the goal of the game is to buy
  the ferry to the mainland, at which point you win, but it's way expensive
  (say ferry, forget about cruise ships)"*.)

  **1. THE ISLAND IS NEVER STATED, AND IT IS NEVER GOING TO BE.** There is no
  line of dialogue, no tooltip and no intro card anywhere in the build that
  says "island", or that the town is surrounded by water, or anything of the
  kind. What there is instead is a **far shore you can see from the beach** —
  two quantised ridges (`hzBack` behind `hzRidge`, both 2px-stepped sine
  profiles), a **lighthouse on the point** whose lamp turns on its own
  four-second beat, a **town across the water** whose thirteen blocks light
  their windows after dark, and a **string of harbour lights** along the rest
  of that coast at night. It sits above the sea band and below the sky, on a
  **0.04 parallax**, so a full pan of the town shifts it 77px: near enough to
  be a place, far enough to be somewhere else. The player is never told the
  geography. They work it out because they can see the other side, and because
  the only thing in the world that costs $20,000 is a boat.
  - **THE NAME IS THE ENDING'S TO GIVE (Matt, 2026-08-19: *"don't put the
    town's name out there, it's going to be a cheeky reveal near the end"*).**
    **CRABALINA** is rendered in exactly two places, both of them the win
    itself: her **hull** as she comes alongside (`drawMooredFerry`, which only
    draws when `won`) and the **ending card** — its title, and the last line,
    "CRABALINA IS ON THE MAP". Nowhere in a running town. The office board
    says TO THE MAINLAND, the fingerpost says THE PIER, the confirm toast says
    THE FERRY, and the SAVED TOWNS header says "YOUR TOWN - SLOT 3". A player
    plays the whole run without learning where they live.

  **2. THE MIST MODEL.** `mistPeak(day)` is an **integer hash of the day**
  (xorshift/imul, then `0.18 + 1.25 * u^0.85` clamped) — no RNG, no saved
  field, no per-town seed, so the weather is a fact about the calendar and is
  the same on every machine. Measured over 200 days: **mean 0.76, 25% of
  evenings clear (< 0.5), 37% a total whiteout**. Biased thick on purpose: the
  brief is "often obscured", and a clear night only means something if it is
  uncommon. `mistNow()` is that peak under a day-shape envelope — **zero from
  09:30 to 16:30** (so the shore is a fact you can go and check at midday),
  rolling in 16:30→20:00, holding all night, burning off 06:30→09:30. The
  small hours read **yesterday's** peak, or the mist would change thickness at
  midnight when `day` ticks over.
  - The render is 60 one-pixel rows of `rgba` whose alpha ramps in from y26,
    **holds at full through the band the far shore stands in (y42-66), and
    eases back off toward the beach** — measured by eye and then fixed: the
    first cut whited out the near water too and read as a broken renderer
    rather than as weather. Five banks of it drift through at their own
    speeds, which is what makes it weather instead of a filter. The colour
    lerps with `darkness()`, so dusk mist is not daylight mist.

  **3. THE HORIZON EARNS ITS KEEP.** Two honest wires, both pure reads:
  - **Imports arrive by sea.** On any day the T1 trade ledger actually shipped
    something in (`trade.day.fish|corn|water|power|fruit > 0`) a small
    freighter works the far channel from 06:00 to 19:30. What the town
    consumes comes from the place on the horizon, and you can watch it come.
  - **She works the far side on Thursdays.** `FERRY_DAY = 3`: on Thursdays THE
    CRABALINA crosses the horizon west to east, low and white with a red
    funnel and a wake — **and she does not call here**. That is the whole
    pitch for the purchase, made without a word of text.

  **4. THE FERRY IS THE WIN CONDITION, AND THE PRICE IS MEASURED.**
  **`FERRY_PRICE = 20000`.** The runs behind it, all `tools/headless.mjs`:

  | strategy | days | seeds | survivors' till |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | do-nothing baseline | 30 | 16 | 0 survive; a few hundred dollars |
  | `--buy chef,table` (the documented growth run) | 40 | 8 | 4/8 alive, best **$3,637** |
  | `--buy chef,table,grill,board,juicebar,arcade,cadegear` | 120 | 8 | 4/8 alive, **$3,696-$6,769** |
  | **`--buy chef,table`** | **150** | **6** | **3/6 alive, $22,991 / $23,797 / $28,971** |

  The middle row is the surprise, and it is why the price is what it is: **the
  side businesses are a net drag on the till** — they add nightly rent and
  pull crew off the shack — so the town that gets rich is the one that goes
  deep on crew and tables and stays out of the property market. Seed 1337 on
  that strategy banks about **$230 a night** once the crew is deep and the
  room is full, and its curve is close to linear from day 40: **$5,090 at day
  41, $11,068 at day 71, $20,660 at day 111, $31,473 at day 160.** So $20,000
  is **~day 105-130 for a strong town** — and the headless buyer is a
  *sensible* player, not a good one; a human working wages, hours, the tip
  slider and a bought-off-the-market showers gets there sooner.
  - **Absurd on sight, which is the point.** You open with $150 against a $276
    first-night bill, and the biggest thing in the shop is the $650 arcade.
    The fare is **133x your starting purse and 31x the arcade**, painted on a
    fingerpost you walk past every single morning.
  - **It cannot fire in the documented curves, and that is asserted rather
    than assumed**: the best till any documented run ever reaches is $3,637,
    i.e. **5.5x under the fare**, and the new suite gate measures the PEAK
    till of both a do-nothing arm and a propped growth arm and fails if either
    comes within 8x / 3x of it.
  - **YOU CANNOT SEE THE WAY OUT UNTIL YOU HAVE BUILT SOMETHING** (Matt,
    2026-08-19: *"the ferry thing shouldn't even show up till you fit the
    arcade; we should just see the ferry"*). `ferryKnown()` = `won ||
    UPS.arcade.lvl > 0`, and it gates **four** surfaces at once: the office
    draw, the fingerpost draw, both world click zones, and `tapFerryChip`
    itself — twenty thousand dollars in hand buys nothing from a town with no
    arcade. What is NOT gated is **the boat**: she still crosses the far
    channel every Thursday from the first morning, because the world is bigger
    than the town and always was. The arcade is the last thing on the lot, so
    the gate reads as *this is a going concern now* rather than a tutorial
    step. Receipt: scenario "the office is shut, and she is nameless, until
    the arcade is fitted" drives the money path AND stubs `smallText` to prove
    the shut office renders zero glyphs and the open one renders no name.
  - **Where you buy her**: a **ferry office** kiosk at the foot of the pier
    (x1806) with MAINLAND FERRY on the fascia, TO THE MAINLAND under it, the
    fare in the 5x7 font, and a **two-tap BUY HER chip** on the exact
    `tapSaleChip` idiom (one geometry function feeds draw and hit-test, the
    arm lapses after four seconds, every refusal says why). And the
    **fingerpost outside the shack** — "THE PIER" over "FERRY $20,000" with
    an arrow east — is the discoverability: it carries the price from the
    morning the arcade opens,
    and **its board turns green the morning the town can cover it**, so a
    player who never once panned east still finds out.

  **5. THE ENDING, AND WHAT BECOMES OF THE CRABS.** `won` is a third flavour
  of `gameOver` beside `bankrupt`, so every stop-the-world guard in the file
  applies for free. It does **not** slam a card over a frozen town: `winFerry`
  swings the camera to the pier, `drawMooredFerry` puts a proper white hull
  alongside with CRABALINA on her bow, and for **2.2 seconds** all you get is
  "THE CRABALINA IS IN" on a plaque. Only then does the card fade up, and a
  click during the beat is swallowed rather than skipping the ending.
  - **The answer to "what about the crabs" is that there is no leaving.** You
    are not buying a ticket out; you are buying the boat, and the crossing
    runs both ways. Verbatim, the whole card:

    > ONE PLATE AT A TIME.
    >
    > SHE COMES ROUND THE POINT ON THE MORNING TIDE,

    The italicised name is a **real crab from that town**, picked at the
    moment of purchase — a fisher first, because they have waited longest —
    and the roster, the population and the housing count are the town's own
    numbers. `winRec` snapshots all of it the instant she is bought and
    **rides in the save envelope**, so a reloaded win reads identically
    however the personas churn afterwards. The SAVED TOWNS row for that slot
    reads **SAILED D118** in green instead of a date.

  **BEHAVIOUR-NEUTRAL, three receipts.** (1) The **frozen day-2 fingerprint
  passes untouched** — no re-baseline, on both seeds. (2) The curves are
  unmoved, against a CONTROL RUN of the same matrices on a pristine HEAD
  `game.js` in a scratch tree — **byte-identical, both of them**: baseline
  `--days 30 --seeds 16` reads **0/16, 9,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,11,12,12,12,
  12,13, median 10, lifetime $49,354** before and after; growth `--buy
  chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` reads **4/8, 9,10,12,13,41,41,41,41,
  lifetime $97,299** before and after. (NOTE FOR WHOEVER READS THIS NEXT: the
  16-seed baseline median at HEAD is **10**, not the 13-14 the older entries
  in this file quote — that figure is stale, and the control run above is the
  receipt. Nothing in this pass moved it.) Nobody in either matrix can afford
  a boat, which the new gate measures rather than assumes.
  (3) The whole draw stack — `drawBG`, `drawTown`, `drawNight`, the far shore,
  the mist, the office and the sign — is driven **thousands of times inside a
  running headless sim** and the day-2 fingerprint comes out byte-identical to
  a run that never drew a pixel, with the layer live AND with `_noHorizon` /
  `_noMist` set; burning 5,000 calls through `mistPeak`/`hzRidge`/`hzBack`
  does not shift the RNG stream either.

  **Suite 116 -> 122**, six new, zero re-pointings: `ferry: she costs exactly
  her price, and buying her is the win` (a dollar short buys nothing, one tap
  only arms, the fare is taken to the cent, the run ends non-bankrupt with a
  record, and she cannot be bought twice or into an overdraft), `ferry: the
  arming tap times out, and an old save never won`, `ferry: the win saves, and
  a reloaded town shows the same ending` (exact `winRec` roundtrip, the beat
  not replayed, the SAVED TOWNS card knowing, plus an old save opening as an
  ordinary town), `ferry: nobody wins by accident` (peak-till measurement on a
  do-nothing arm and a propped growth arm), `horizon + mist are pure draw`,
  and `mist: clear at noon, thick most evenings, and a clear night is news`.

  Shots: `horizon-clear-midday`, `horizon-mist-dusk` (the same camera at 19:15
  on a thick evening - the shore simply gone), `horizon-clear-night` (the
  windows and the harbour lights over there), `ferry-office`,
  `ferry-fingerpost`, `ferry-arrives`, `ferry-ending` and `ferry-ending-tall`
  (288 mode: the card is H-independent, so both canvases get the identical
  ending) under shots/.

  **Left for later, deliberately:** the mist is a sea-and-horizon layer only —
  it never rolls up the beach and over the town, which would be a bigger
  visual change than a draw-layer pass should make and would fight the
  readability of the shop floor. The ferry has no *service* once bought (she
  arrives and the run ends). And nothing mechanical keys off the weather: a
  clear evening is worth exactly the pleasure of seeing across, which is the
  point of it.
- **Needs fail in their own character: THE TRUDGE and THE WIDE BERTH** (built
  2026-08-19, worktree — realizes `design/needs-failure-patterns.md` for three
  of the five needs, to Matt's pick, verbatim: *"Dirt boredom and tiredness are
  good; hunger and thirst should just be a speed penalty."* The doc's RAID
  (H1) and SHORT LEASH (T1) are therefore **rejected and not built**, and so
  is D2, the smudge trail, which the doc holds back and the owner did not
  pick.)
  - **HUNGER AND THIRST ARE A SPEED PENALTY — one shape, two needs.** A linear
    ramp to **−25% at a pinned 1.00**, so the player watches a crab FLAG rather
    than a switch flip. Each ramp starts where that need already cost the town
    something, which is why the thresholds differ and the slope does not:
    **hunger from 0.30** (crabEff's own hunger line — past 0.30 it already
    slowed prep; now it slows pace too) and **thirst from 0.50**, pitched so
    the ramp passes through **exactly 0.85 at thirst 0.80** — the same value
    as the −15% cliff it replaces, at the same threshold. **The cliff is
    deleted**; nothing about the T2 balance point was moved on the way past.
  - **THE ANTI-SPIRAL GUARD is a FLOOR plus an EXEMPTION.** Hunger already
    drags prep through `crabEff` and both needs already feed the nightly
    sickness roll, so the two ramps MULTIPLY but are floored at
    **`DRAG_FLOOR` 0.70** — starving *and* parched is −30%, never −44%. And a
    crab is **never slowed on the walk to the thing that would fix it**
    (`selfCareNeed`: the tap, the counter, their own kitchen — the need being
    fixed is the only ramp switched off). That is THE SELF-HEALING RULE read
    straight, and it is the doc's own guard on the rejected leash ("the leash
    exempts water") carried across to the penalty that replaced it. It also
    makes the fix legible: the moment a starving crab decides to eat, it picks
    its feet up.
  - **HEAT SHIMMER** (the doc's T2, shipped as the free companion it was
    pitched as): a parched crab LURCHES rather than walking uniformly slow — a
    sine about 1.0 keyed to `time` and the crab's own `animT`, so it is
    **mean-preserving by construction** and costs nothing mechanically (suite
    -asserted: two minutes of parched walking with and without it land within
    2%). It never reaches zero either, so a panting crab still counts as a
    MOVER to `collide()` and still clears the no-progress watchdog.
  - **DIRT IS THE WIDE BERTH (doc D1).** `crabBerth` opens a crab's personal
    space from the collider's **12px to 22px** on a ramp from dirt **0.60**
    (crabEff's dirt line) to 1.00. Three deliberate shapes, and all three are
    wedge guards rather than taste: it is **asymmetric** (only the CLEANER crab
    gives ground, so the filthy crab is never pushed and can always reach its
    station, its queue or its cot); the ground is given **sideways in Y**, and
    **backwards in X only by a crab that is standing still** (a still crab has
    no forward progress to lose, which is the same still-vs-mover distinction
    the core collider already makes, so the 1.5s watchdog can never read the
    bubble as a pin); and it **adds to** the core 12px physics rather than
    replacing any of it, so ordinary crab traffic is byte-for-byte what it was.
    It has to run *inside* 12px as well as outside — the core push shrinks to
    nothing as it approaches 12, so a pair resting AT the old radius would
    otherwise never enter the bubble's range (measured: three crabs in a staged
    huddle sat at exactly 12px and never got the berth). **Suppressed at home
    and after dark** — four crabs on shelter cots cannot each have two
    body-widths, and this is a boardwalk read.
  - **The town's other two refusals.** A tourist **will not sit at the table
    beside a visibly filthy crab** (`SHUN_AT` 0.80, a 26px ellipse — geometry,
    not taste: the shack's tables sit 40px apart across and 24px back-to-front,
    so a wider radius would shun the whole dining room and turn the refusal
    into a no-op). **There is always an out, and the out is THEY SIT ANYWAY**:
    if every free table has a filthy crab beside it the guest takes the first
    one rather than standing, so filth can never deadlock the dining room. (The
    alternatives — queue, or walk out — were rejected because seating is the one
    place a refusal could strand a paying guest for good.) Their **own** server
    never counts as "the crab at the next table" — a filthy server is already
    charged for through the tip and through the patience drain. **Patience**:
    a tourist served by a filthy crab burns it up to **30% faster**, on the same
    0.60→1.00 ramp the bubble opens on. Locals are colleagues and are not fussy.
    The doc's REP clause is deliberately NOT built (the doc itself says ship it
    dark and turn it on in a second measured pass).
  - **Legibility.** A two-frame `STINK_MARK` (wavy lines) bobs over any crab
    whose bubble is open, so the empty boardwalk has a cause at a glance; the
    follow card gets a **RANK** mood; and the dossier gets a **WALK** row next
    to PACE — "TRUDGING AT 70% — HUNGRY, PARCHED" — so the number and the reason
    are both on the record.
  - **Measured, illness and death** (12 solvent towns × 30 days, the shape the
    mortality work used), before → after:
    | | before | after |
    |---|---|---|
    | deaths | 11 (0.92/town) | **9 (0.75/town)** |
    | lane | 11/11 NEGLECT | 9/9 NEGLECT |
    | crew / townsfolk | 0 / 11 | 0 / 9 |
    | infections | 51 | **37** |
    | causes | hunger 12, thirst 16, dirt 28, contagion 11 | hunger 13, thirst 18, dirt 19, contagion 5 |
    The anti-spiral gate is met with room: **the trudge does not kill anybody**.
    Paired arms inside the same build (`window._noNeedDrag`) agree — with the
    ramps collapsed the same 12 towns read 13 deaths and 54 infections, i.e. the
    signal is noise at ~1 death per town, and the shipped build is on the low
    side of it either way.
  - **Measured, no wedge.** This was the named risk — an inflated collision
    radius is exactly the thing that could make crabs bounce off each other
    forever — and it is the reason the berth is asymmetric, sideways, and
    additive. The routing pass's own busy town (arcade + 4 crew, 5 days),
    widened to **three** towns because one town's sidestep count swings ±2 on
    stream order alone: **0 warps + 17 unsticks before → 0 warps + 18 after**,
    i.e. one extra sidestep in fifteen busy town-days. Across the 12 solvent
    towns × 30d: warps **0 → 5**, unsticks **237 → 266** over 360 town-days —
    0.014 warps and 0.74 sidesteps a town-day, inside PLAN's documented
    "~1-2x/day town-wide". The suite gate runs the crowded shack with a crab
    **pinned filthy all week** against a `window._noBerth` paired arm.
  - **Balance**: baseline 16 × 30d **0/16**, evictions 11,12,13,13,13,13,13,
    14,14,14,14,14,14,14,14,20, **median 14** (before 0/16, 11–20, median 15 —
    the documented per-build day of wobble). Growth `--buy chef,table` 8 × 40d
    **6/8 alive**, 11,14,41,41,41,41,41,41 — **byte-identical to before**.
    **One number was tuned, and it was one of ours**: with the hunger ramp
    starting at 0.5 the do-nothing town came out RICHER than the pillar allows
    (2 of 16 surviving 30 days, median 14) because the self-care exemption
    makes the trips that matter for health *faster* than the pre-merge build
    — the same mechanism the public tap moved the curve by. `DRAG_HUNGER_AT`
    0.5 → **0.3** restored 0/16 and left growth untouched. No price, wage or
    rent was touched.
  - **Suite 98 → 102.** New: `trudge: hunger and thirst are a speed penalty,
    and it SCALES` (the curve, a two-minute walk-distance integration, the
    shimmer's mean-neutrality, and a real commute that finishes measurably
    later when starved), `trudge: the speed penalty does not kill anybody
    (anti-spiral gate)` (paired arms over 6 solvent towns × 30d), `dirt: THE
    WIDE BERTH` (the ramp, the separation, that the FILTHY crab is never the
    one pushed, that the bubble is suppressed indoors, the declined table, the
    sit-anyway out, and the patience multiplier), and `dirt: a filthy crab in
    a crowded shack wedges nobody` (warps/unsticks against a `_noBerth` arm).
    **Re-pointings (4, receipts written into the scenarios):**
    1. `hours: defaults are behavior-identical (frozen day-2 fingerprint)` —
       re-baselined, because `crabMove` itself changed and SUDSY ends day 2 at
       hunger 0.70 / thirst 0.50 in both seeds. Receipt: on seed 4242 **every
       position is byte-identical** (all five crabs asleep in the same beds)
       and the books give a little back (coins 214.01 → 200.80, serves 39 → 37)
       — which is what a throughput cost looks like; on seed 1337 exactly one
       crab moves, SALTY sleeping on a shelter cot instead of in house 7,
       a day behind on the housing ladder rather than stranded.
    2. `taps: nobody in a full town is left parched for a week` — a
       **measurement bug**, not a loosened gate. `perDay` was each crab's OWN
       sample count / 10, so a drifter who steps off the bus on day 8 and is
       thirsty from arrival divides two real days by 0.2 samples-per-day and
       scores "10.0 days without a drink". Latent (it needs a late, thirsty,
       short-lived arrival) and this build's stream produced four of them.
       Normalised on the TOWN's sample rate the same three seeds read a worst
       dry spell of **3.1 days here and 2.6 days on the pre-merge build**.
       Recorded honestly alongside it: the worst crab's time on the 0.95
       dehydration line went **~7% → 18.7%** of its life (SUDSY, seed 17, a
       ten-hour owner-operator day). That is the trudge's price, it sits under
       the 25% gate, and it does not reach the mortality — same matrix, fewer
       infections and fewer deaths.
    3. `routes: furniture avoidance keeps warps + unsticks near zero` —
       **widened from one town to three**, which is a stricter gate, not a
       looser one. Receipt: its own comment still claimed "0 + 2", but the
       PRE-MERGE tree measured **0 + 7 against a gate of 8**, so it had
       quietly become a coin flip that the next merge in either direction was
       going to trip. Paired arms inside the needs build read 5, 7 and 9 on
       that single town with identical code. Three towns read 0 + 17 before
       and 0 + 18 after.
    4. `cpu hours: SUDSY's policy converges and never thrashes` — the FIXTURE,
       for the third time and the same reason. It already props SUDSY's TILL
       because a bankrupt shop cannot demonstrate 30 days of hours policy;
       seed 1337's SUDSY now **dies on day 15** of a seven-day neglect illness
       (an owner-operator on a ten-hour day is the crab the trudge is hardest
       on), her lease sweeps onto the market, and `runHoursPolicy` rightly
       declines to run for a business nobody owns. So the fixture props her
       health as well: she still falls ill and still takes her own sick days,
       the tide just doesn't take her. Not a hidden regression — the 12-town
       matrix has SUDSY taken in **3 of 12 towns before and 3 of 12 after**,
       with the total down 11 → 9.
  - **Story beat (organic, reproducible)**: `node tools/headless.mjs --days 12
    --seeds 1` — seed 1337, no buys, no props, the town still standing on day
    13. **SUDSY spends day 4 walking at the 0.70 floor for one hundred percent
    of the day**, pinned at hunger 1.00 / thirst 1.00 / dirt 1.00, with the
    wide berth open around her every minute of it: the slowest crab in town
    and the only one nobody will stand next to. Day 5 the same. Then day 6 she
    eats and drinks — peaks fall to 0.33 / 0.46 — and **the trudge vanishes
    while the bubble stays**: day 7 she walks at 96% and is *still* given a
    wide berth for the whole day, because her dirt is 0.80 and dirt is a
    different failure. That is the thesis in one working day. Day 9 she
    relapses to 1.00 / 1.00 / 0.90, trudges at 75% for most of it, and falls
    ill; days 10–12 she convalesces, needs nursed down to 0.10–0.30, pace back
    to 100%, and by day 11 the boardwalk closes back around her.
    Shots: `trudge-race` (a fed crab and a starving one, same trait, level
    start, 86px apart six seconds later), `trudge-dossier` (PACE and the new
    WALK row together), `berth-clean` / `berth-filthy` (eight crabs shoulder to
    shoulder, then the line breaking open around the one with stink lines over
    her head) under shots/.
- See also **NEEDS THAT FAIL IN THEIR OWN CHARACTER** (its own section below
  the public-taps entry): boredom's drift and tiredness's stall, 2026-08-19.
- **Business failure, FOR SALE and succession** (Matt's fault report, built
  2026-08-19, worktree — a directed build during the closing act, not a new
  front): *"sudsy goes bankrupt every day.. the shop needs to close till some
  crab can buy it then, rite?"* He was right, and it measured: seed 7 kept
  alive 12 days, SUDSY's till sat at $0 for **1861 of 4215 sampled ticks**
  and her shop spent **781 ticks DARK**, bankrupt twice, debt written off each
  time. A zombie: a permanently half-shuttered shower house and nothing ever
  changed.
  - **FAILURE is the credit machinery, not a new rule.** `settleCreditLine`
    now REPORTS `missedMin` (behaviour-identical for the player: `ok` is
    unchanged, the player's cliff is still BANKRUPT). At settlement a peer
    owner's lease that misses the minimum — or can't even draw the night's
    bill — is a **STRIKE** (`bizStrike[biz]`, per LEASE so an owner with two
    shops loses only the one that failed). `SALE_CFG.STRIKES = 3` in a row and
    the shutters go up; a single clean settlement wipes the slate. The debt is
    no longer forgiven and `NPC_DARK_NIGHTS` is retired to a legacy-save path.
    Toasts name the countdown ("SUDSY MISSED THE SHWR RENT - 2 NIGHTS TO PUT
    IT RIGHT").
  - **CLOSING is real.** `BIZ[k].owner = null`. `bizDark` reads it, so the
    existing gates do the work with no new special cases: no tourist spawns,
    no errand dispatch (`bizStaffed`), "IT'S SHUT" on a right-click order, no
    job-board postings, no hours/labor policy. Staff **and the
    owner-operator** are laid off by `layOff()` — NPCs to the pier with a
    fishSpot (`p.fisher = true`, the town's default profession) and a way back
    via the job board, crew back to the player's kitchen. They still pay their
    $10 house rent tonight and ride the same shelter ladder as everyone. Named
    in the toast and in the day report ("SHWR CLOSED - FOR SALE $180",
    "SUDSY, DRIFT LAID OFF - BACK TO THE PIER").
  - **THE PRICE IS LEGIBLE**, fixed at listing, every term checkable on the
    sign: `rent x SALE_CFG.RENT_NIGHTS (3)` (the lease) + `SALE_CFG.FIXTURE
    ($15) x every station spot, stall and table` (the kit) + `GOODWILL_DAYS
    (2) x the shop's recent daily takings` (from a rolling 3-day `bizTake`
    book, not a guess), floored at two nights' rent. SUDS SHOWERS prices at
    **$180** dead (105 lease + 75 fixtures + $0 goodwill) and **$194-210**
    when it was still taking money on the way down.
  - **SUCCESSION.** `runSuccession()` at settlement: book the day's takings,
    sweep any business whose owner has left the town onto the market (**the
    death seam**, one loop — an owner who dies leaves a business, not an
    orphan), then clear the market to the deepest pocket who can pay
    `price + SALE_CFG.RESERVE ($30, three nights of house rent — nobody buys
    their way onto a cot)`. Eligible: **any NPC crab** — a fisher, a hired
    hand, an ex-owner, someone who already owns a shop (they just add a lease
    to the same till). The player's own crew are under contract with the
    player and stay out of the pool; the player buys for themselves.
  - **The money never inflates.** The buyer pays the price out of savings;
    `FLOAT_FRAC 0.5` of it becomes the shop's OPENING TILL (stock, soap,
    change in the drawer) and the rest is the lease transfer Mr. Pincherton
    pockets — destroyed, exactly like rent. The player's till IS `coins`, so
    their float never leaves their pocket: they must HOLD the full asking
    price, and their real cost is the transfer (half). Documented asymmetry,
    not an accident.
  - **A new owner is data.** `OWNERS[slug(name)]` is minted, `p.owner`/`p.job`
    /`shift D` set, and they inherit `HOURS_POLICY` + `autoLabor` + `sickPol`
    **because those tables key on the BUSINESS, not on SUDSY**. The dossier
    reads "RUNS SUDS SHOWERS" (fixed: an owner who is also a fisher used to
    read "FISHES OFF THE PIER"). All of it — the registry, who holds which
    lease, `bought`, `market`, `bizTake`, `bizStrike` — roundtrips save/load,
    and an old save opens with SUDSY behind her own counter.
  - **UI**: boards nailed across the shopfront + a **FOR SALE $N** placard and
    a **BUY IT** chip, painted after the y-sorted pass so they sit in front of
    the stalls; a BUSINESS FOR SALE block on the TOWN JOB BOARD card (price,
    why it closed, days on the market, "ANY CRAB WITH THE SAVINGS CAN TAKE IT
    ON"); and a FOR SALE line on the management screen. The player's buy is a
    two-tap arm on the chip (`tapSaleChip` — the click listener only decides
    which chip was hit, so the suite drives exactly what a tap drives).
  - **Balance**: baseline 30d x 8 **0/8, 10,11,13,13,14,14,15,16 median 14**
    (before: 11,11,13,13,14,14,15,16, median 14 — one seed moved a day).
    Growth `--buy chef,table` 40d x 8: **3/8 alive, 7,9,15,20,39,41,41,41**
    (before 4/8, 7,9,15,22,41,41,41,41) — one marginal seed dies on day 39 of
    40. Documented, not tuned away, per standing policy. **Attributed**, seed
    5348 (`--seedbase 3`), 40d, before vs after: showers served **83 -> 83**
    and SUDSY's shop takings **$801.94 -> $801.94, byte-identical** (the shop
    was already dead by the day-21 closure — it earned everything it was ever
    going to earn first), but NPC spend at the player's shack
    **$1555 -> $1191 (-23%)** and tourist serves **763 -> 678**, and the town
    ends on 2 crew instead of 5. THE MECHANISM: the zombie was a MONEY PUMP.
    SUDSY's shop pulled ~$800 of outside tourist money in over 40 days and
    she recycled it into the player's shack as owner draws ($30 at a time);
    once she is a fisher there is no till to draw from. That pump is worth
    ~$9/day to a growth town, which on a knife edge is 5 crew vs 2. It is
    seed-dependent in sign — across 6 seeds the same figure went the other
    way ($1022 -> $1110), because a laid-off owner who fishes at a good
    market price can be a BETTER customer than a failing shopkeeper.
  - **Measured knock-on** (6 seeds x 40d, kept-alive chef+table town, before
    vs after): mean dirt across all crabs **0.808 -> 0.809**, showers served
    **91 -> 91**, infections **17.67 -> 17.67**, dirt-caused illness
    **15.83 -> 15.67**, NPC spend at the player's shack **$1022 -> $1110**,
    guests served **679 -> 703**, lifetime takings **$12946 -> $13412**. The
    headline finding: **the zombie was already contributing nothing.** A shop
    whose till sat at $0 for 44% of the run and went dark on a rota barely
    washed anybody; closing it honestly costs the town's hygiene nothing
    measurable, and the laid-off owner becomes a FISHER who spends her catch
    money at the player's counter — the player's takings go slightly UP. (The
    town's dirt is high either way; a free public water tap is the other
    agent's answer to that, and this build deliberately does not build a
    second one.)
  - **The player can buy it and it pays**: a crew-staffed SUDS SHOWERS takes
    **$161-184/day** against its $35 rent (seed 77, days 3-5), so the $210
    asking price (net $105 to the player) pays back in a day.
  - **Suite 82 -> 88.** New: the three-strike closure + layoff + stops
    trading; a saved-up crab buying it and the shop trading again under the
    new owner's policies; the player's shopfront buy path (refusal, arm,
    sign, rent bill, crew staffing, takings); a 20-day closure soak with
    wallets clamped under the asking price (no wedge, no frozen crabs, the
    town keeps trading); and the ownership + market save/load roundtrip in
    three arms (listed / sold to a crab / bought by the player, plus an old
    save with none of the keys); plus the death seam — an owner deleted from
    `npcs` mid-run leaves the shop listed "gone", not orphaned.
    **Re-pointings (2, receipts in the
    scenarios):** `credit: balance, flags and NPC lines roundtrip save/load`
    — its "pre-credit save" fixture must now also delete the `owners`
    registry, or it isn't the old save it claims to be; `cpu hours: SUDSY's
    policy converges and never thrashes` — seed 1337's SUDSY now FAILS on day
    9, and a shop that is out of business cannot demonstrate 30 days of hours
    policy, so she gets the same solvency prop the player already gets in that
    scenario.
  - **Story beat (organic, reproducible)**: `node tools/headless.mjs --days 60
    --seeds 1 --seedbase 7 --buy chef,table` (seed 10696). **Day 19**: SUDS
    SHOWERS misses its third lease. SUDSY loses the shop she owned outright —
    and takes her hired hand **DRIFT** down with her; both back to the rail.
    The town has no shower house for 25 days. **Day 44**: **SHELLDON**, a
    fisher who came in off the morning bus, has $210 saved and buys it for
    $180. The shutters come off and the stalls run again — under a fisher.
    (Seed 6685 tells the same story with **DRIFT** buying it on day 54, after
    SUDSY's day-31 failure.) Shots: `forsale-shopfront`, `forsale-jobboard`,
    `salty-owns-showers`, `salty-dossier-owner`, `player-bought-showers`,
    `manage-forsale-line` under shots/.
- **A working day has a length; labour is bought by the hour** (two measured
  balance faults, fixed 2026-08-19, worktree — Matt: "the strategy of just
  making your restaurant open all the time is way too powerful; we need to
  make that non viable except in emergencies", and the owner's reading that
  "CLAWDIA is OP"):

  **FAULT 1 — ALWAYS-OPEN WAS STRICTLY BEST.** Shifts DERIVE from the shop's
  hours, so setting the shack 6:00-24:00 handed two crabs nine-hour shifts —
  50% more staffed hours — for a flat `CRAB_WAGE` and a flat `TIRED_SHIFT`
  bump. Measured on this tree (player shack only; peer owners keep running
  their own hours policy in both arms, which is the honest comparison):

  | arm (30d/40d x 8 seeds) | default 8-20 | always-open 6-24 |
  |---|---|---|
  | baseline, survivors | 0/8, evictions 11-16, median 14 | **6/8**, median 31 |
  | baseline, lifetime | $34,238 | **$104,876** |
  | growth `--buy chef,table`, survivors | 4/8 | **8/8** |
  | growth, lifetime | $94,258 | **$279,000** |

  **The wage lever cannot reach it, and that is measured, not argued.** A
  staffed hour is worth ~$25 of takings in this town and costs $3.83 of wage,
  so cancelling always-open through pay alone would need a ~12x wage. Nor can
  fatigue: a CEILING PROBE that pinned the crew at `tired = 1.0` on every tick
  for 30 solid days still ended a 6-24 town on $9,713 against a default town's
  $2,331. Cost-side levers are an order of magnitude short. The environment
  had to change.

  Two changes, both **inert on a default trading day** (verified: with the two
  new loads forced to 1 and the nap off, the 8-seed growth matrix reproduces
  the pre-pass build byte-for-byte — 7,9,15,22,41,41,41,41, lifetime $94,258,
  wages $16,330):

  - **A WORKING DAY HAS A LENGTH** (the load-bearing half). `bizShiftWindow`
    caps every derived window at `SHIFT_SPAN` for its kind — a six-hour M or
    E, a ten-hour owner-operator D, a twelve-hour cover double, which is
    exactly what each evaluates to under the town's default 8-20 — and a
    window that outgrows its cap keeps its MIDDLE, centred on the middle of
    the trading day. The cap never binds on a trading day of 12h or less, so
    8-20 is the old geometry to the minute (and 6-22 still reads 8-14/14-20).
    Open 6-24 and the crew still work 9-15 and 15-21: the shoulders are open
    but UNSTAFFED, and nothing walks into an unstaffed shop — tourist spawn
    and errand dispatch are both staffing-gated already, so there is no
    wedge and no queue to strand.
    **Staffed hours are bought with CRABS or with OVERTIME, never off the
    hours sign.**
  - **LABOUR IS PRICED BY THE HOUR.** `CRAB_WAGE`/`NPC_WAGE` are day rates for
    a STANDARD day of that shift. Two measures, differing on exactly one day:
    `shiftLoad` (today's span / a standard day of that KIND — the CONTRACT;
    a cover double is one contracted day) drives pay and the shift-end
    hunger/thirst bump, and `workLoad` (the same span / the crab's OWN
    standard — the WORK; a cover double is two shifts) drives tiredness.
    `otPremium` now reads a constant `hourlyRate` instead of dividing by
    today's shift, so a squeezed or stretched shift can never make overtime
    cheaper than straight time. Shorten the day and the wage bill shortens
    with it: a 9-17 shack pays its four-hour shifts $15 and tires them 0.30.

  **FAULT 2 — THE EVENING SHIFT WAS FREE REST.** Sleep only repaired tiredness
  while `darkness() > 0.7`, so a crab up at 07:15 for a morning shift lost
  recovery the evening crab kept, and the morning crab's long free AFTERNOON
  at home repaired nothing. It followed the SHIFT, not the crab: swapping the
  two founders' shifts swapped the penalty. Fix the environment — `TIRED_NAP`
  repairs tiredness while a crab is home, SETTLED and off the clock in
  daylight, at a fraction of the bedtime rate and on the same housing rung (a
  cot naps worse than a bed). Night sleep is untouched, including the walk
  home, so nothing else moves.

  | 6 seeds x 10 days, mean tiredness | M | E | gap |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | before | 0.153 | 0.087 | 0.066 |
  | before, founders' shifts SWAPPED | 0.171 | 0.084 | 0.087 |
  | after | **0.106** | 0.085 | **0.022** |
  | after, SWAPPED | 0.119 | 0.089 | **0.030** |

  `TIRED_NAP` 0.4/0.2 was chosen by measurement, not taste — the sweep read
  gap 0.047 at 0.15, 0.039 at 0.25, 0.033 at 0.35, 0.024 at 0.40, 0.020 at
  0.50 (and 0.50 IS the bed rate, which would make an afternoon on the porch a
  night's sleep). **Tiredness keeps its teeth**: the town's illness rate is
  10.40% before and 10.40% after, to two decimal places. TRAITS were not
  touched — the brief's measurement (tidy 87 dishes vs speedy 101 per 10 days)
  stands and nothing here re-tested it.

  **Measured after** (same arms, same seeds):

  | arm | default 8-20 | always-open 6-24 |
  |---|---|---|
  | baseline, survivors | 0/8, evictions 11-17, **median 14** | 0/8, 11-14, median 14 |
  | baseline, lifetime | $34,523 | $33,506 |
  | growth, survivors | **4/8** at day 40 | 4/8 |
  | growth, lifetime | $99,162 | $91,145 |

  Both documented curves hold (baseline 0/8 median 14; growth 4/8 at day 40)
  and always-open now earns LESS on both. The sharpest single number is
  takings per crew-day — dollars earned per dollar of wage bill, the one thing
  the hours sign used to inflate for free: **1.58-1.84 before, 0.98-1.08
  after**. A subsidised steady-state probe (6 seeds, both arms kept solvent)
  lands the two within ~3% of each other, i.e. a wash — which is the honest
  landing for "non viable except in emergencies": there is no longer a reason
  to do it, but nothing forbids it.

  **The emergency lever survives, priced.** Long hours open ROOM at both ends
  of the day that OVERTIME can fill. Under the default 8-20 an OT request just
  doubles up inside the same 12 hours (union 720 min); open 6-24 and the same
  request extends the town's trading to 14 hours (union 840 min) at $11.50 a
  crab — exactly 1.5x the standard hourly rate — and switches off cleanly back
  to a $46 bill.

  **Interactions checked**, all still correct: a COVER DOUBLE pays one wage
  (untouched) and now tires like a double (0.9); an OT SHIFT pays and fatigues
  on the same clock, byte-identical at default hours; a DAY OFF is still
  unpaid and still promotes a coworker; SICK DAYS, AUTO-MANAGE and SUDSY's
  hours policy all pass unchanged (her policy walking showers down to 9-17
  now also shrinks that shop's wage bill, which is the same rule read the
  other way). Every render path — MENU bill, all three management tabs, the
  dossier — smoke-tested at 8-20, 6-24 and 9-17.

  **Suite 82 -> 87.** Five new scenarios, ALL FOUR of the gates plus the
  geometry pin verified RED on the pre-pass build:
  `hours: a working day has a length`, `hours: always-open does not out-earn a
  normal day (anti-exploit gate)`, `hours: the emergency lever survives`,
  `tired: fatigue scales with the hours actually worked`, `tired: the morning
  and evening shifts end the week level`.
  **Re-pointing: exactly one.** `tired: a workday accrues it; sleep drains it,
  bed beating cot` — (a) the +0.45 bump was read off the roster at 19:30,
  which now measures the AFTERNOON NAP instead of the bump, so it is read as
  the day's PEAK (the bump itself is unchanged); (b) the "daylight accrues
  nothing passively" clause asserted tiredness never MOVES off the clock, and
  daylight rest is the whole fix — it now asserts tiredness never RISES off
  the clock. The frozen day-2 fingerprint tripwire needed NO re-baseline: it
  passes unchanged, which is the receipt that a default town is untouched.
- **Labor policy suite: sick days + overtime + scheduling + town census**
  (shipped 2026-08-18, worktree — realizes the "Labor policy suite" and
  "Town census" feature requests and the parked **Overtime** backlog entry):
  - **SICK DAYS are a policy now.** A sick crab always stayed home unpaid;
    what was missing was that it *meant* anything. `BIZ[k].sickPol` is
    GRANT (default = the old behavior, inert) or REQUIRE WORK, with a
    per-crab override `p.sickPol`. A required crab drags themselves in at
    half speed, earns full wage, and finally makes the settlement block's
    long-dormant coworker-contagion term fire (until sick days were a
    policy, no crab could ever be at work to trigger it). Fishers and
    owner-operators always grant themselves. A granted sick day takes
    effect the moment it's granted — a crab mid-commute turns around.
    Coverage behaves exactly like the weekends placard: `bizRestingToday`
    counts sick-day crabs, the sign reads **OUT SICK**, and the job board's
    emergency posting deliberately does NOT fire (a bout of flu is not a
    vacancy — the same reasoning that spared rest days).
  - **THE CARED SEAM IS CLOSED.** Recovery's `cared` check read only hunger
    and dirt — it predated thirst and tiredness, so a day in bed bought
    nothing. Recovery is now a graded ladder (`CARE_LANES`), keyed to the
    same housing quality the sleep ladder uses:
    NEGLECT 0.12/0.25 and CARED 0.40/0.08 are **byte-for-byte the old
    odds** (nobody got worse), and two new lanes sit above them, reachable
    only by actually staying home on a granted sick day, fed AND hydrated
    (thirst < 0.5) for `REST_HOURS` 9 daylight hours: **COT REST 0.48/0.06,
    BED REST 0.55/0.04**. `p.restT` banks daylight hours at home while ill
    and resets at each settlement.
    **Measured** (`node tools/illness.mjs --seeds 120`, paired arms — the
    care table is collapsed back onto the old odds *inside the same build*,
    so the comparison can only differ on the seam):
    | arm | mean | median | p90 | deaths |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | own bed, before | 2.63d | 2d | 5d | 12 |
    | own bed, after | **2.28d** | 2d | **4d** | **4** |
    | shelter cot, before | 2.43d | 2d | 4d | 7 |
    | shelter cot, after | **2.18d** | 2d | 4d | **4** |
    | bed lot rolled at COT odds (rung, paired) | 2.57d | 2d | 5d | 5 |
    Bed rest cuts 0.35 days off an illness, cot rest 0.25, and the housing
    RUNG itself is worth **0.29 days** on identical seeds. 74 of 120
    convalescents reach a rest lane; the other 46 never clear the
    fed/clean/hydrated bar and sit on the untouched CARED odds.
    Organically (6 solvent towns x 24d) most illness is still NEGLECT —
    the rest lanes are what a *managed* town gets.
  - **OVERTIME.** `p.ot` lengthens today's shift by up to `OT_SPAN` 120min
    at `OT_RATE` 1.5x the crab's normal hourly rate (= wage / their own
    contracted shift, never the cover double), paid on top of the flat day
    at settlement. **Shop-hours coupling (the documented choice):** OT
    lives strictly INSIDE the shop's open hours — hours gate admission and
    the CLOSED sign, so an hour past close is premium pay for nothing. The
    window takes room at the END first, then borrows from the START, so an
    E-shift crab whose shift already ends at close comes in EARLY — exactly
    the shape that plugs a missing morning. A crab covering a full-open
    double has no room at all, by construction. Health cost: no parallel
    system — the existing end-of-shift accrual scales with the longer day
    (hunger proportional, tiredness at `OT_FATIGUE` 1.5x that share).
    Minutes are MEASURED (`c.otMin`), not assumed, so knocking off early
    pays less. BILL chip + MENU breakdown both read `crabDueTonight`, so
    the column adds up; the bankruptcy forecaster deliberately keeps
    billing BASE wages as steady state (same rationale as the day-off
    skips — episodic, and noise over a 10-settlement horizon).
  - **VISIBLE OT POWERUP.** A chunky coffee cup with curling steam
    (`OT_MARK`, two frames) bobs over any crab clocked in past their
    contracted hours, plus an OT tag on the follow card and an OT row on
    the dossier. All of it reads `onOvertimeNow` / `otMinutes` — derived
    from live state, so it clears itself with nothing to reset.
  - **SCHEDULE + TOWN tabs on the management screen.** The manage card
    grew a tab strip: HOURS (as it was), SCHEDULE (AUTO-MANAGE and SICK
    DAYS chips, then one row per staffer with four tap targets — name opens
    the dossier, SHIFT cycles M/E/D, OT toggles, SICK cycles shop-rule ->
    grant -> require) and TOWN (the census). Days off stay derived and are
    shown, not set. The dossier's SHIFT row is the OT control and its
    HEALTH row the sick-day control, beside TAP: REASSIGN as specced.
  - **AUTO-MANAGE** (`LABOR_CFG` + `runLaborPolicy`, the SUDSY hours
    pattern): one move per settlement, a cooldown day after each, a named
    toast every time. Rules in order — **REST** (an ill crab under a
    REQUIRE policy is sent home), **OT OFF** (a crab on OT who is over the
    tiredness budget, ill, or no longer needed), **OT ON** (tomorrow leaves
    a shift uncovered AND a rested candidate exists). Converges because the
    tiredness triggers are a HYSTERESIS BAND (0.55 on / 0.75 off), never a
    knife edge, and OT itself pushes tiredness up — every ON move weakens
    its own trigger; on the coverage axis the regimes are disjoint.
    `coverGapTomorrow` keys on SICKNESS, not days off, because the day-off
    cover double already fills those for free. Default OFF for the player,
    ON for peer owners — SUDSY grants herself sick days by this table.
    Suite-proved over a fortnight: never two moves in a day, never two
    consecutive days.
  - **TOWN CENSUS.** Every crab in town, one 16px two-line row: shell
    portrait, name, job/employer, wallet, housing, health, then shift, day
    off, OT, PACE and five mini need bars — all derived live. Sort
    NAME/JOB/HOME/HEALTH/WALLET, filter ALL/CREW/TOWN/SICK/OT, six rows a
    page with `<` `>` paging (the card idiom's answer to a 12+ crab town —
    no scrollbar). Tap a row for that crab's dossier, which now draws ON
    TOP of the management card so closing it drops you back in the census.
    Reachable from the job board's TOWN CENSUS chip too: the board
    advertises the labor the town wants, the census reads the labor it has.
  - **Measured balance** (30d x 8 seeds): baseline 0/8 evictions
    7,8,10,10,11,11,12,14 **median 11** (before: 7,8,10,11,11,11,12,14,
    median 11 — one seed moved one day); growth `--buy chef,table` 0/8
    6,7,8,9,10,10,10,16 **median 10** (before: 6,7,7,9,10,10,11,16, median
    10). Both medians UNCHANGED, no price or policy lever touched. The
    player-facing defaults are near-inert by construction: sick days GRANT
    (the old behavior), auto-manage OFF, `p.ot` false.
    OT uptake, 6 solvent towns x 24d: **auto-manage OFF measures literally
    zero** OT minutes and zero moves; delegated it runs 29 crew-hours of
    overtime town-wide for $166 of premium ($5.77/OT-hour = exactly 1.5x
    the $3.83 base hourly), 2.8 moves per town, and evening crew tiredness
    moves 0.20 -> 0.21 — the fatigue cost is real but bounded, because the
    rota pulls crabs off at 0.75. SUDSY's till is a wash (mean $38 -> $27,
    driven entirely by one seed; five of six seeds sit at $0-1 either way,
    exactly as the fixed-hours control does).
  - **Suite 65 -> 73, with ZERO re-pointing.** Every existing sickness pin
    ("disease: care cures, neglect can kill", "sick crabs can still wash")
    held unchanged, because the seam was built additively — the NEGLECT and
    CARED lanes keep their exact old odds. Eight new scenarios cover the
    bed-vs-cot duration shift, GRANT vs REQUIRE, the exact 1.5x rate + OT
    geometry + needs acceleration, marker render/clear, auto-manage
    convergence, SUDSY running the same policy, census derivation +
    sort/filter, and save/load roundtrip with clamping.
  - Fixed en route: `font.js` was missing `%`, `<`, `(`, `)`, `=` and `*`
    from the 3x5 small font — all six fell back to `?`, which means every
    PACE chip in the game has been reading "100?" since the needs-drag
    build. Added.
  - **Devlog beat (organic, seed 1337, no buys):** SUDSY runs herself
    ragged on day 2 — thirst 0.85, hunger 0.6 — and the settlement lands
    her ill. Days 3 and 4 she hangs OUT SICK on her own shopfront and stays
    in house 5: 14 game-hours abed each day, needs nursed back to zero,
    care lane BED REST. The day-4 roll cures her at the 0.55 lane and the
    town's only shower attendant is back on her stalls on day 5. She
    granted herself that sick day by exactly the rule the player's SCHEDULE
    tab exposes. Shots: `census-town-tab`, `schedule-tab`, `ot-powerup`,
    `sick-day-placard`, `dossier-sick-day`, `dossier-overtime`, plus
    `census-portrait` / `schedule-portrait` under shots/.
- **Shop hours + management screen + CPU owner policy** (shipped 2026-08-18,
  realizes backlog "Business settings"; SHIFT CAP added 2026-08-19,
  see "A working day has a length" above): every business carries real OPEN
  HOURS (`BIZ[k].hours`, default 8-20 = the old hard-coded day; bounds
  6:00-24:00, min 4h, `setBizHours` clamps). Hours gate tourist admission
  (spawn filter + `anyBizOpenNow`), home-errand dispatch (per target biz),
  the CLOSED sign, and ANCHOR the shifts: `bizShiftWindow` derives M = first
  half, E = second half, D = open+30..close-90, cover = full window - the
  SHIFTS table keeps the shape, hours give it a frame (defaults evaluate to
  the exact old windows). Deliberately staffing-gated, not hours-gated: the
  fisher-breakfast and after-shift-dinner paths, so a staffed counter still
  serves the early/late crowd (bit-identity depends on this). MANAGEMENT
  screen: tap a player-owned shop's sign/MANAGE chip - hour steppers (30min),
  today's per-biz takings/costs (`today.biz` via creditBiz/debitBiz), roster
  with derived shifts + days off, and staff-meal policy RETAIL/AT COST/FREE
  (`BIZ[k].mealPol`, wired at the selfCook charge site; retail default).
  CPU owners: `HOURS_POLICY` table + `runHoursPolicy` at settlement - dead
  first hours 3 days -> open 1h later; dead last hours + clean closes ->
  close 1h earlier (span floor 6h); queue at close 2 days -> extend 1h within
  the staff-tiredness budget (tired < 0.75). One move/day max, history resets
  after a move + 1-day cooldown -> converges, never thrashes (suite-proved
  over 24 days; SUDSY typically walks 8-20 down to ~9-17/8-14 because her
  boundary hours genuinely see no traffic; toast "SUDSY NOW OPENS AT 9").
  All of hours/mealPol/policy state save-roundtrip with clamping migration.
  Measured: defaults BYTE-IDENTICAL to the pre-feature build (8 seeds x 30d,
  full stats blobs, policy disabled via `window._noHoursPolicy`); with the
  policy live the baseline is 0/8, 7-11 median 10 vs 7-14 median 10 (only
  the day-14 tail seed moved) and growth chef,table reads median 9 vs 10 -
  one seed-day, the documented per-build wobble; an 8h-floor damping probe
  measured the identical growth list (the shift is stream chaos from her
  first move, not the shrink depth), so the 6h floor stays. Her till:
  seed-dependent (one seed way up, one down, two a wash - the fixed-hours
  control drains to ~$0 in 3/4 seeds too over 24 kept-alive days).
- **Weekends / days off** (shipped 2026-08-18): a 7-day week derived from
  `day` (day 1 = MON, weekday in the clock). Every working crab — crew, NPC
  staff, owner-operators, fishers — rests one weekday, derived at runtime
  from day + roster (per-biz base weekday, name-sorted stride-3 fan-out; no
  save change, nobody rests MON/TUE). Off day: no commute/duty/pay (wage
  loops + BILL/MENU skip via the same predicate; `workedToday` keeps pay
  truthful across mid-day rota reshuffles from job-board hires), sleep-in
  to 9:30, then errands all day at relaxed thresholds (FUN 0.35 vs 0.6 —
  E-shift crabs finally get arcade mornings) as full retail customers,
  beachcombing between errands. Coverage: an uncovered shift promotes the
  on-duty coworker to a full-open 8-20 double (M/E never overlap, so this
  is revenue-neutral); single-worker shops honestly close — showers SUN,
  a one-crab arcade FRI, staggered apart — under a DAY OFF placard, which
  deliberately does NOT fire the job board's dark-shop posting. Fisher off
  days thin `townCatch` (~half supply that day with 2 fishers: DRIFT THU,
  SALTY SUN). Dossier shows OFF: <WEEKDAY>S, follow card shows OFF <WD> +
  DAY OFF statuses, day report names the resters. Measured: baseline 0/8,
  evictions 11-15, median 13 (pre-feature: 10-19, median 13); growth
  chef,table 0/6, 7-14, median 12 (pre: 10-18, median 13).
- **Day report card** at closing: guests served, takings, walkouts, wages,
  rent, till, word-of-mouth swing, busiest crab, and the day's illnesses,
  recoveries, deaths and moves. Click to dismiss.
- **Accomplishments**, not XP: crabs count the dishes they've served; at 25 /
  100 / 250 of a dish they get the knack (−5%), get famous (−12%), or master
  it (−20% prep time) for that dish only, announced in a toast and shown on
  their follow card. Rewards watching a specific crab grow into a specialist.
- **Needs drive performance** (`crabEff` in game.js): a well-kept crab works
  at 1.0; hunger past 0.3 costs up to −18%, dirt past 0.6 up to −6% (floor
  0.76). Applies to station prep, stall cleaning, and — gently, with a kicker
  below eff 0.85 — kitchen hustle speed. Pinned-needy crews serve ~25–45%
  fewer dishes over 5 days than well-kept ones (suite: "needs bite").
  Surfaced as a PACE % chip on the follow card and a "WORKING AT N%" dossier
  row when impaired. Fishing casts are deliberately NOT coupled: the whole
  town eats the catch, and any measurable drag there re-tilts the calibrated
  economy (tried at full and half weight; both broke the knife-edge one-crab
  states). Tune only against the matrices + suite, never by feel.
  **Paired with `needDrag` since 2026-08-19** (see "Needs fail in their own
  character"): `crabEff` is what a neglected crab's WORK costs, `needDrag` is
  what its WALK costs. Two separate curves on purpose — a crab can be visibly
  trudging and still working at 100%, or the other way round — and the dossier
  shows them on two rows, PACE and WALK.

## The trade horizon (Matt, 2026-08-18) — land it by degrees

**North star**: the town is one **node** in a wider trade network. Everything
is produced *idle-style* — like Overcooked, crabs must go to stations to keep
things running (this eventually reaches power stations, but that's far off).
The town imports what it can't make and will eventually export what it can;
other idle economies get built as sibling nodes and connected together
slowly, as the infrastructure builds itself out.

**Current target: a complete and beautiful "fishing town node" with
external-facing stubs.** Everything below serves that.

Staged landings (each stage ships alone, suite-green, balance re-verified):

- ~~T1~~ **shipped 2026-08-18** — IMPORTS table (fish $7 / corn $3 / water $1
  gal / power $2 kwh), tradeImport() counters (today + all-time + $ spent),
  wired: import-fish at consumeIngredient (the only charged flow, as before),
  water per shower (8/14 gal) and wash cycle (12; flow removed with the laundromat), corn per taco, power per
  arcade serve. Ledger renders on the town notice board. Save/load
  roundtrips. Zero new charges by construction (suite scenario asserts
  spent === fish x $7 exactly).
- **T1 — Trade ledger (bookkeeping only, zero balance change)** (original spec): an `IMPORTS`
  commodity table with *fixed prices* — corn, fresh water, electricity,
  imported fish (already exists at $7) — and running counters for quantities
  imported (exports later). Wire existing flows in: import-fish purchases,
  showers/laundry consume water, arcade consumes electricity. A TRADE ledger
  view (notice board or MENU tab). Not connected to anything yet — the point
  is the tracked flows exist before anything depends on them.
- ~~T2 — Thirst + juice bar~~ **shipped 2026-08-18** (built to the spec
  below; measured deltas):
  - Landed exactly as spec'd: accrual +0.35 shift end / +0.15 nightly /
    +50% while sandy > 0.5; drink errand at 0.45 between food and clean;
    landing risk +0.12/night at 0.95; −15% walk at 0.8; NO crabEff term.
    (The −15% CLIFF was replaced 2026-08-19 by the scaled trudge, which passes
    through exactly 0.85 at thirst 0.8 — same value, same threshold. The "no
    crabEff term" call still stands.)
    JUICE $6 / COOLER $9 (first two-input recipe via optional `raw2`),
    juicer x2 + counter in the old cleaners lot at 752-880 (the job board
    at x716 keeps its sliver), rent 55, $400 in the vacated shop slot.
    IMPORTS gains fruit $2; every drink counts fruit, each COOLER a gallon
    of water — tracking only, spent still === fish × $7 by suite assert.
  - Fallbacks the spec was silent on, decided by the systems map: with no
    bar, a drink errand buys the shack's own juice ($10, unchanged); staff
    of a dark shack/bar pour their own at retail (selfCook generalized to
    biz+need). Any juice quenches, even one bought as lunch.
  - **Tourist drinks are ADDITIVE demand** (weight 0.3): beachgoers who'd
    never queue for a plate grab a drink; the spawn interval shrinks so
    every other biz keeps its exact pre-bar flow. Pure weight-splitting
    made the bar a strictly-bad buy (it traded $13-17 plates for $6-9
    drinks); additive demand is the "new demand stream" reading.
  - Knobs: **wage 22 → 23** (the sanctioned raise — with wage 22 the drink
    recycle stretched the baseline to median 14 with a 20 tail; a $1 raise
    landed it at median 11-13 with wallets bounded 8-32). Shack juice price
    and all spec numbers untouched.
  - Measured: baseline 0/8, evictions 8-14, median 11 (16 seeds 8-18,
    median 13; was 8-16 median 12). Growth `--buy chef,table` 1/6 escapes,
    eviction days identical pre/post; `chef,table,juicebar` 1/6 (same
    days — the late-game bar is roughly neutral); `chef,juicebar` 0/6 but
    the bar-first seeds run to median 22 vs baseline 11 — the bar roughly
    doubles runway without escaping alone. Suite 38/38.
  - Also fixed en route: a hold-and-wait kitchen deadlock (waitSlot/waitCash
    chefs squatted ON the station spot the slot-holder was walking to —
    night pours made it common; waiters now step into the clear lane).
- **T2 spec (draft, 2026-08-18, pending Matt's read)** — thirst + juice bar
  land as ONE measured pass, immediately after laundry removal merges:
  - **THIRST need**: parallel to FED, faster cycle (casual, frequent): +0.35
    at shift end, +0.15 nightly, +50% accrual while sandy > 0.5 (beach heat).
    Drink errand at thirst ≥ 0.45, priority between food and clean. At
    LANDING thirst adds sickness risk (≥ 0.95 → +0.12/night, the scariest
    neglect) and a parched walk penalty (≥ 0.8 → −15%), but deliberately NO
    new crabEff prep-drag term — one new death-spiral pressure at a time;
    coupling into crabEff is a later loosening with its own matrix run.
  - **JUICE BAR**: the $400 rung in the vacated _biz1 shop slot and the
    vacated cleaners lot (~680-860). Player-owned shopfront, rent ~55,
    juicer x2 + counter, recipes JUICE $6 (fruit) and COOLER $9 (fruit +
    fresh water), prep 1.5-2.5s — cheap, fast, high-throughput. Tourists
    order drinks too (new demand stream on the rep curve). Staff drink at
    retail, same policy as meals.
  - **Ledger (T1 hooks)**: new IMPORTS entry fruit $2; every drink counts
    fruit and 1 gal water through tradeImport(); still tracking-only until
    T3 charges sourcing.
  - **Matrix plan**: measure the COMBINED removal+juicebar curve (removal
    lands measured-inert first, so movement attributes to T2): target
    median 11-13, evictions 7-17, via --jobs matrix; watch crew wallets —
    thirst spend at retail is a real drain, and the precedent is RAISE THE
    WAGE (22 → measured value) rather than discount drinks. Growth check
    gains a juicebar buy strategy in the headless buyer. Suite adds: thirst
    serviced end-to-end, parched-spiral risk, juicebar economics + ledger
    flows, and the no-inflation guard re-run.
- **T3 — Ingredient sourcing for everything**: recipes get real ingredient
  lists (corn → tortillas → FISH TACO is the pilot; the `raw:` field and
  `consumeIngredient()` are the embryo). A pantry + a receiving station where
  imports physically arrive (morning delivery), and a crab has to work the
  station to restock — production is idle-style, not a passive rate.
- **T4 — The boat** — **shipped**: a live-aboard boat as the fisher-only top
  housing rung (shelter → house → boat), bought at the same nightly
  settlement that runs the rest of the ladder. Numbers: $75 + $2/night
  mooring fee (vs $35 move-in + $10 rent); 3 named berths (PEARL, GULLWING,
  SQUALL) moored off the pier's seaward rail, hull trim in the owner's
  color. A boat is owned outright — a broke night runs a tab, never an
  eviction — and the vacated house frees for the next climber. Owners fish
  from their own deck: ~12 fish/day vs ~5-6 off the pier (faster casts +
  20% double hauls). Sim-verified: fishers reach the boat organically
  ~day 23-25 (3 of 4 seeds), and the baseline eviction curve is untouched
  (0/8, median 11, identical day list) because boats land after the
  do-nothing window. The player's boat waits on backlog "player-avatar
  crab" + "fishing expansion".
- **T5 — Exports + external-facing stubs**: an export dock — surplus catch
  (and later goods) sold off-node at fixed prices, both directions visible in
  the ledger. Every commodity flows through named ledger entries so future
  sibling nodes (farm, power station) can plug in without surgery.

Sequencing rule: fixed prices and untracked externalities are *fine* — track
first, connect later. Don't build the network before the node is beautiful.

- **Hiring-as-recruitment + standing lots** (Matt's directive, built
  2026-08-18, worktree): "hiring new crabs shouldn't make a house pop into
  existence; we should recruit them from the tourist pool or something, and
  the houses just exist empty already." Systems bullets above have the
  mechanics. Measured: baseline 30d x 8 seeds BIT-IDENTICAL (0/8,
  evictions 7,8,9,9,10,10,10,14, median 10 — baseline never hires, as
  expected); growth `--buy chef,table` also bit-identical eviction days
  (0/8, 7-10, median 10) — homeless hires (no $10 house rent, cot-rate
  sleep) and the occasional converted-away paying tourist net out to
  nothing measurable on the eviction curve. No price tuning. Suite 53/53
  (3 new scenarios; zero existing pins needed re-pointing — the rehire and
  rota scenarios only pin "hire completes immediately", which holds).

- **Fisher self-sufficiency** (Matt 2026-08-18, shipped): self-employed
  fishers take breaks whenever a need presses (the errand loop re-commutes
  them to the pier after), and a hungry fisher who can't afford town food
  roasts one of the day's catch on the beach (never the town's last 2 fish —
  no money moves). Measured: fisher min-hunger 0 weekly, no starvation
  sickness. Baseline settled at 0/8, evictions 8-12, median 10 (roasts +
  break-time trim fish supply slightly).

- **Shop hours + management screen** (Matt 2026-08-18): agent building.
  Per-biz open hours as real data (defaults behavior-identical), a
  management overlay for player bizes (hours steppers, per-biz takings,
  staff list, staff-meal pricing policy RETAIL/AT COST/FREE finally wired),
  and CPU owners adjusting their own hours via a small convergent policy
  with named toasts ("SUDSY NOW OPENS AT 9").
- **Tourists become recruits; houses stand empty** (Matt 2026-08-18): agent
  building. Hiring no longer mints a persona + house from thin air: hires
  convert from the visiting tourist pool (name preserved) or arrive on the
  morning bus, start homeless at the shelter, and climb the ladder like
  everyone else. All 9 house lots render permanently - vacant ones look
  vacant. Another brick in the all-crabs-equal wall.

- **Save management** (Matt 2026-08-18): agent building. Multiple save slots
  (5, migrating today's single key into slot 1), IMPORT/EXPORT of save files
  (upload a town, download a town), and a save screen whose slot preview
  shows the CREW in detail — portraits, names, jobs, housing, health — "for
  easy remembering" which town is which. Validate-before-mutate on import;
  a bad file must never touch the running game.

## THE OPENING: THE TOWN, THEN THE BOAT (Matt, 2026-08-19, shipped worktree)

Matt, verbatim and complete: *"the game should start with no tourists present;
might want to bring back free first day of rent for that actually"* — one
directive and one HEDGE. The first shipped. The second was measured and
**declined**, and the number is below.

### Half one: a new town opens EMPTY
The visitor pass gave a new town a boat-load already mid-stay on the promenade
(`seedVisitors`, `ferryBatch() + 6`), which robbed the opening of its beat: the
player met the trade before they met the town. Now the game opens at **07:00
with nobody ashore**, the intro/lease card holds the clock (the sim only
advances while `screen === "play"`), and the **08:00 sailing** — one game-hour
after the town wakes, the fattest boat of the day at `FERRY_LOAD[0]` 1.2 —
lands the first tourists the player ever sees. The timetable was NOT touched:
day one starts before the first sailing, so all four boats still run and day
one loses no trade to the beat.

What changed in code is three lines and a flag:
- the boot call is now `if (hasSave && preVisSave) seedVisitors()`;
- `preVisSave` is set in `load()` from the absence of the save's `_vis` marker;
- `seedVisitors()` itself is unchanged, and survives for **exactly one job**:
  migrating a PRE-FERRY save, which has no guest list to restore and would
  otherwise reload a fortnight-old town onto a deserted promenade.
**Deliberately not inside `load()`**: a modern save that legitimately holds no
visitors (saved at midnight, say) must stay empty rather than have a crowd
conjured onto it.

### Half two: the free first night, and why it is NOT back
**The history.** CS3's first commit (`df95139`) shipped with
`rentAmount() { return day <= 1 ? 0 : BIZ.shack.rent; }` — a rent-free opening
night. `e6e3476` (2026-08-18) deleted it: *"No more honeymoon: rent is charged
from night one and you open with $150 in your pocket — pressure from the first
minute."* It was a package, not a lone deletion — the same commit cut the rent
**255 → 230** and pinned the opening purse at **$150**. The compensation for
losing the honeymoon was a cheaper rent, and it is still in force.

**The cost of the empty start, measured (16 seeds, days 1-3):**

| day-one, mean over 16 seeds | seeded crowd | empty start | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| takings | **$313.1** (median 313, 290-329) | **$275.5** (median 286, 202-342) | **-$37.6** |
| till after the 20:00 settlement | **$144.9** (median 147, 130-156) | **$111.1** (median 114, 62-165) | **-$33.8** |
| day-2 till | $156.4 | $115.9 | -$40.5 |
| day-3 till | $193.1 | $162.3 | -$30.8 |

**So the empty opening costs about $34** — a seventh of one night's rent. No
seed ends day one underwater (worst till $62), nobody draws credit, and the
hole is carried forward rather than compounded.

**A free first night hands back $230 — 6.8x what the change took.** Measured as
a probe on the empty-start tree (`--days 30 --seeds 16`, buy nothing): still
**0/16**, but **median eviction 11 → 16**, evictions **11-24**, lifetime
**$55.6k → $72.6k**. Five extra days of life for a do-nothing town, against a
$34 hole, and straight past the documented **median 11-13** band. That is not
compensation, it is a different game — a quiet softening of a baseline whose
whole promise is to lose. **Declined.** The probe was reverted; the reasoning
sits in the comment above `rentAmount()` so nobody re-opens it from memory.

### Balance — before -> after (measured on this worktree, control at `aefd7a0`)

| matrix | before | after (empty start) |
|---|---|---|
| baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16` | **0/16, median 11** (6,9,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,14,15,15) | **0/16, median 11** (9,9,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,13,14,16,17) |
| growth `--buy chef,table` 40d x 8 | **3/8** (6,8,11,11,11,41,41,41) | **2/8** (10,11,11,11,13,26,41,41) |
| growth, second block `--seedbase 8` | **2/8** (10,11,11,13,14,15,41,41) | **1/8** (8,9,9,10,11,12,18,41) |
| growth, both blocks (16 seeds) | **5/16** | **3/16** |

**LOSE-BY-DEFAULT IS UNTOUCHED** — 0/16 and median 11 on both sides, which is
the promise that matters. **GROWTH IS ONE TOWN DOWN IN EACH BLOCK** (two across
sixteen), and that is the honest cost of an opening that is $34 poorer at
exactly the moment a growth town is saving for its first chef. Attribution is
trivial because there is only one change in this pass; the knob that would undo
it is a $230 handout for a $34 hole, which the probe above disqualified. If
Matt wants those two escapes back, the honest lever is one sized to $34 (the
opening purse, say) and chosen deliberately — not the free night.

### Suite 142 -> 147 (green, exit code 0, 867s on a loaded machine)
New: `a new town opens EMPTY: nobody ashore, nobody mid-walk`; `the first ferry
still lands, on time, and day one keeps all four sailings`; `the lease card
holds the clock: no boat lands while Pincherton talks`; `a loaded save keeps
its guests: the empty start is a NEW-GAME rule`; `a PRE-FERRY save still gets a
crowd: the one branch seedVisitors keeps`.
RE-BASELINED, with the reason written in-scenario: **the frozen day-2
fingerprint**, which runs exactly the two days that the seeded crowd used to
cover — serves roughly halve (66 -> 38, 61 -> 41), SUDSY's till halves with
them, rep is 5 points lower, and the player's till is $64/$105 down at the end
of day two. Two fixtures that used to CLEAR the opening crowd are now no-ops
and are kept as belts, with their comments re-pointed to say so.

## CRAB SCIENCE (2026-08-22) — the bench, and what a recipe turned out to be

A lab town, entered from the title. You set a seed, an opening plan, a span
and a stopping rule; the bench lives the whole town out at speed, then hands
you its days on a bar you can walk back and forth, and lets you step into any
morning of it and keep playing. Shipped deliberately small: three plans, three
rules, one seed, days as the grain.

**A run is a RECIPE, NOT A RECORDING**, and the recipe is the URL —
`?lab&seed=4242&plan=2&span=8&rule=0` is a whole experiment, which makes a
town a thing you can hand somebody as a link. The numeric era is what pays
for this: integers end to end and one counted stream mean (seed, plan) fixes
every day that follows.

**A KEYFRAME IS A SAVE ENVELOPE, one per day.** Measured before building on
it: an envelope is NOT a bit-exact freeze of an instant — reload a town
mid-walk and its crabs stand where the loader puts them, its session counters
restart. That is right for a game save, and it fixes the honest meaning of a
scrub here: a keyframe is A MORNING YOU CAN GO BACK TO, not a paused frame.
Landing on one costs **0.28ms** (it is a load, not a re-simulation), so the
bar is instant at any length; living the town costs about **12 sim-days/sec**
with the kernel armed, **7** without.

**THE LESSON THAT COST THE MOST.** The first design reset the world in place
between runs instead of booting clean, and chasing that reset taught something
worth keeping: the town came back identical by every measure I could name —
draws, positions, needs, ledgers, furniture bits, pool slots — and still
diverged on the twenty-four-thousandth tick, inside one visitor's mind, over
residue nobody had thought to look for. **A boot has no residue.** So a run is
a boot: the seed is installed above the world's own construction, and the
founding crabs are already that recipe's crabs. Three real leaks were found on
the way and are fixed where they were: the agent pool overflowed at 160 when
twenty landings ran without a tick between them (the mark-and-reap never got
its beat), the furniture kept its guests because occupancy is a plane BIT
rather than a field (a fresh morning opened onto a full hotel), and the
session ledgers — the earnings history the rival prices her ambition from, the
queue's ticket counter — carried the last town's books onto the new town's
desk.

**IT NEVER SCRIES YOUR TOWN**, which is the standing ruling ("interface
opacity is a bug, economic uncertainty is the game") holding against the
obvious back door. Science runs are their own towns on their own seeds; the
lab reads no slot and writes none while it runs; PLAY THIS DAY hands you a
copy that becomes an ordinary town in the ordinary way. Your saved towns are
never rewound, because a lab that could rewind them is a save-scummer with a
lab coat on.

Left for later, named rather than half-built: player-authored stopping rules
(that is Layer-1 bytecode work — the fixed `SCI_RULES` table is the seam they
plug into), sub-day scrubbing, comparing two runs side by side, and any
parameter the seed matrices carry that the four rows do not.

## THE PIGS SHIP (2026-08-22) — the first bundled cultureway

Pigs arrive in a town nobody staged. Before this, `cultures.pig` existed only
as a suite fixture: MEASURED, a fresh town reached rep 100 against an arrival
gate of 80 — wide open — with `CULTURES` holding nothing but `crab`, so no
player could meet a pig at any reputation, ever. The gate was fine. There was
simply nobody on the mainland.

**How it ships.** `cultureways.js` carries the document (generated from the
fixture the suite has proved against since spec-01, by `tools/mkcultureways.mjs`
— edit the fixture, regenerate, and the suite is still testing the thing the
player gets). `loadCultures` installs the bundled documents FIRST and lets a
save's own documents overlay them by id, and boot installs them even when
there is no save. Two consequences worth stating: a player who authors their
own pigway **replaces** ours rather than fighting it, and a bundled culture we
improve later **reaches every existing save**, because saves carry the
player's documents and never ours (`rawCultures` stays the save's own). A
document that fails its clamps is refused with a toast and the bundled one
stands in its place — a broken file in a save is the player's file going
wrong, not a reason to take the world's peoples away from them.

**MEASURED.** 16/16 baseline towns see a pig, first landing median **day 7**
(min 6, max 11) — earned, not wallpaper: rep must cross 80 first. Baseline
floor **0/16 both ways**, median 11 → 12 (inside the documented ±1 band).
Growth **4/16 both ways, unchanged**. Mixed signs throughout. **No fingerprint
re-baseline was owed** — the frozen two-day pins live at rep ~53, below the
gate, where the roll short-circuits before the draw, so the pre-pig world is
byte-identical. The gate bought that.

**Two findings the shipping exposed, both for phase 2.** First: pigs arrive,
find nothing they want to eat, and **leave hungry and unspent** — seen live on
a day-18 departures card, BIG PALP taking home $136 of $136 and complaining
"GETTING ON THIS BOAT HUNGRIER THAN I GOT OFF IT" while PETUNIA files it as "I
DEPART UNFED. THE REPORT WILL BE FRANK." The taboo is working exactly as
written and the town has no answer to it, which is precisely what **pig dishes
and venues** are for. Second, related: the fish taboo barely differentiates on
the shack's two-plate menu, because she is lukewarm on the taco (0.6) as well
as the fish (0.5) — her character actually lives in the drinks and the
bathhouse (juice 1.6, cooler 1.8, room 1.7, **soak 2.0**), which are mostly
NPC businesses. That is why growth lifetime moved DOWN slightly with pigs
aboard: **pig money flows to the showers and the hotel, not to the player's
shack.** A rival who runs the showers now banks an offer's worth of intent in
a single day of pig custom — the paired arm in the rivalry scenario had to
starve her once more to keep asking its question.
## PUT DOWN BESIDE A THING, A CRAB CONSIDERS IT (Matt, 2026-08-22) — a ruling

> "we should make it so when crabs get dragged somewhere they interact with
> the nearest thing as their next preference"

**THE DROP NUDGE.** A crab set down within 72px of a counter, a standpipe or
the beach ball takes that place as a preference for a game-hour: the need it
serves has its bar lowered by 0.12, and the stop itself gets a ×1.3 thumb on
the appeal scale. Constants live in one `NUDGE` table, because what a stop is
worth to a people is culture rather than physics — a Layer-0 hook table in
waiting (`cs35-cultureway-substrate.md`).

**IT IS AN INCENTIVE, NOT A PUPPET STRING**, which is the whole ruling and the
reason the middle scenario exists: a crab put down at the juice bar at thirst
0.20 has the nudge live on its back and walks away anyway. Dropped broke, on
the clock, or at a shut shop, it refuses in its own words, in the vocabulary
the refusals always used. The player tilts the scales; the crab still decides.

**HALF OF IT ALREADY WORKED, AND THAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE ANYTHING WAS BUILT.**
`errandDetour` is zero at the stop you are standing on, so a dropped crab at
thirst 0.50 already bought a drink — proximity was already winning among the
candidates that existed. What it could not do was make the bar a candidate at
all: at 0.30 the same crab walked away from the counter it was standing at. The
nudge's real work is the THRESHOLD; the appeal bump is the smaller half.

**IT COSTS THE REFEREES NOTHING.** The nudge fires only on a player's order,
and no headless run issues one — so the 16-seed matrix is byte-identical to the
tree before it (same eviction list, same `lifetime $53892`) and not one frozen
fingerprint moved. A player lever that the regression detectors cannot see is
the cheapest kind of feature there is.

## SEND: ORDERING A CRAB IS ONE SENTENCE ON BOTH DEVICES (Matt, 2026-08-22)

> "also needs to be drivable via the phone"

Ordering was a RIGHT-CLICK, which is a gesture no phone can make: the whole
feature was desktop-only — not a mode the mouse earned, just one touch never
got. The sentence is now **select, SEND, place**: tap a crab, tap the SEND chip
on its card, tap where they should go. The mouse keeps right-click as its
shortcut over the same two steps, exactly as hover arms the shop tooltip for
free — the shop button's own doctrine, applied to the town.

**AND THE DRAG STAYS THE CAMERA'S.** Because the sentence is two taps and never
a drag, a finger that moves is unambiguously a pan and a finger that does not is
a tap; there was no gesture to arbitrate. Verified on a 390×844 portrait
viewport with real touch events: SEND arms, a pan while armed pans and does NOT
dispatch the crab, and the next tap dispatches and disarms.

## A SAVE KEEPS ITS SEED (Matt, 2026-08-22) — a ruling

> "yeah we gotta definitely keep the same seed, seems obvious"

A save describes a town's PRESENT **and its FUTURE**. The sim stream's cursor
rides in the envelope (`rs`), and `load()` adopts it, so reloading a town after
playing on brings back the same town — same guests off the same boat — instead
of resuming from wherever the session happened to leave the dice. The stream is
town state, exactly as `T` and the pool bookkeeping turned out to be in the
loader-reset pass; this is that pass's last outstanding question, answered.

`SAVE_VER` is unchanged: the fields are additive, and an older save (which never
wrote a cursor) derives one from its own bytes — not the future it would have
had, which was never written down, but the same future every time it is loaded.

**The view stream is NOT part of this.** The title screen's wander and the music
shuffle are the session's own, unsaved and unrestored; attract mode repeating
each boot is tradition, and a save has no business dictating it.

Boot still draws from the host: a brand-new town has no save to replay. Giving a
fresh town its own founding seed from its first breath is a larger landing, and
the close-out records what it costs (`design/cs35-research/numeric-wip/stream-cursor-closeout.md`).

## ON DUTY IS NOT A REFUSAL (Matt, 2026-08-21) — a ruling

An owner's business order to their own staffer fires MID-SHIFT: the boss can
pull a crab off the counter, `abortActivity` releases the station and any
claimed order (the same path ground-clicks on duty crabs always used), the
errand runs, and `updateSchedule` marches them back to work from "home" while
the shift window is open. The price is the unstaffed minutes — the same price
the on-shift break already charges; nothing is conjured. The `atWorkplace`
"ALREADY ON THE CLOCK" no-op refusal stays (ordering a crab to where they
already are means nothing). Ruled on CS3, dropped there, landed here — CS3.5
owns it now. The relaxed scenario assertion is mutation-tested: reinsert the
gate and "orders: redirect walks the crab there" fails on the mechanism.

## ONE ACCOUNT PER CRAB (Matt, 2026-08-20) — a ruling

> "sudsy was able to finance way more money than he had in his wallet — we
> can't have multiple accounts per crab, that's nuts"
> "assets need to be fully disclosed in the interface; one account per crab"

**THE RULE.** A crab's money is their pocket. A business's money is its till. A
lease may carry a credit line. **That is all the accounts there are**, and no
actor may bid, promise or spend against anything else. The player's structure
IS the NPC structure — this is the same "simulation, not arcade" call that
retired NPC_WAGE and made the ownership layer symmetric.

**WHAT IT CAUGHT.** The rival was bidding against FOUR pots — a hidden war
chest (`rival.fund`), her till, her pocket, and credit-line headroom — while
`acceptRivalOffer` settled out of TWO. Measured on seeds 909/1337 over 30 days:
**every offer she ever made was unpayable** ($435 against a $63 purse), so a
player who accepted got "CAN'T COVER" and nothing happened. **The accept path
had never worked, in any town, on any day** — and no test caught it because
every rivalry scenario asserted the offer was MADE, never that it could be
TAKEN.

**THE FIX, and the shape worth copying.** `rivalRaise()` IS `rivalPurse()`, so
no number exists that is larger than what she holds. Better: **coverage is part
of what "a live offer" MEANS** — `rivalOfferLive()` asks whether she can pay,
and the shopfront chips, the card chips, both hit-tests and the settlement all
read that one predicate. The original bug was two numbers computed in two
places drifting apart; a single predicate cannot drift from itself.

**Her purse moves during a day** (wages and rent leave the same till), so a
standing bid can dip under its own number by lunchtime. While it is under there
is nothing to accept and the card says so — *"BID $189 BUT IS DOWN TO $141
TODAY"* — rather than showing a button that would fail. At settlement she
withdraws it by name.

**DISCLOSURE IS PART OF THE RULE.** Every line that names a number an actor
might pay also names what they are holding. If a surface shows a price, it
shows the purse behind it.

**Balance: unmoved.** 0/16 with identical eviction days seed for seed, growth
unchanged. It had to be — the money was always conserved, and the path this
fixed had never once completed.

## THE PROMENADE IS NOT ZERO SUM (measured 2026-08-20)

Written down because the rivalry arm asserted the opposite for a week, and
because it changes how any future pricing work should be measured.

**Footfall is fixed** — `priceAppeal` decides whose door a visitor walks
through, never how many land. That is true and it is the design. It does NOT
follow that the town's trade is zero sum, and it is not:

|                     | board x1.3 | x1.0 | x0.7 |
|---------------------|---|---|---|
| player's drinks sold | 190 | 199 | 207 |
| rival's showers sold | 222 | 213 | 258 |
| **total visitor buys** | **810** | **835** | **851** |

**A visitor's purse is finite, so a cheaper town lets the same money buy MORE
THINGS.** Cutting your own price grows the whole promenade's transaction count
— the rival's trade rose 16% in the arm where the player's rose 9%, so the
player's SHARE FELL while their lever worked perfectly. **Never assert a
pricing claim as a share of a rival's business.** Assert it on your own
numbers.

### ...and the price lever is REDUNDANT, which matters for mutation testing

It reaches trade two independent ways: **appeal** (whose door) and
**affordability** (whether the purse stretches). Kill either alone and the
monotonic trend survives on the other — measured both ways. So a single-channel
mutation cannot fail the rivalry arm, and a mutation test that "passes" against
one channel proves nothing. The mutation that bites is making the PLAYER'S OWN
board inert while the rival's still moves: 199/199/199, flat, caught.

**The general lesson, which cost four mutation runs to learn:** when a lever
has more than one path to its effect, mutation-testing one path and seeing the
test still pass does not mean the test is weak — it may mean the mechanism is
redundant. Find the mutation that severs *all* paths for the actor under test,
or you will either trust a weak test or discard a good one.

## RUNNING A FLEET: two ways agents stand on each other (2026-08-20)

Both of these cost real hours today and neither is obvious until it happens.

**1. `pkill -f tools/suite.mjs` KILLS EVERY AGENT'S SUITE, NOT YOURS.** Five
sessions were running the same command from different worktrees. I killed a run
of mine that way twice; at least one of those took a subagent's 26-minute run
with it, and it had no way to tell that from a crash. **Kill by PID**, from the
`$!` of your own launch, or match on your own worktree path.

**2. A SHARED `/tmp` LOG PATH TRUNCATES SOMEBODY ELSE'S RUN.** `/tmp/suite.log`
and friends are one file on one machine. Two agents redirecting into it get one
interleaved, truncated file and both read a false result. **Put the log inside
your own worktree**, or name it after your branch.

**2b. AND A REUSED LOG PATH IS THE SAME BUG WITH ONE AGENT.** I wrote rule 2
for the fleet and then walked into it alone: successive runs all wrote to
`.measure/parent-suite.log`, so when a later run replaced the file, TWO armed
monitors reported the SAME stale result — a suite figure from a tree that had
been edited twice since. Nothing warned me; the numbers were plausible and
simply belonged to a different build.

**Give every run its own log file, named for what it is measuring**, not for
who is running it. "Mine versus theirs" is not the axis that matters — "this
run versus the last one" is, and a monitor cannot tell them apart.

**3. A RELAYED FACT IS A CLAIM, AND SO IS A RELAYED CONSTRAINT.** A sibling
session reported a real bug and attached two details: line numbers, and a width
("the credit measures 264px on a 256px screen, so it needs its own line"). Both
were wrong. The line numbers were stale; the width was measured in the 5x7 font
when the call site is 3x5, where the worst case is 175px and fits easily. Taken
at face value, the second one would have had somebody split a line that did not
need splitting — a rework caused entirely by trusting a number that arrived
pre-measured.

**Measure the constraint against the thing you are changing, even when someone
has already measured it.** Especially then: a number that arrives with a
report reads as settled, and this project has now been bitten three times in
one day by a plausible number nobody re-derived (the illness figure I wrote
into this file, the growth pillar, and this).

The sibling's own diagnosis of their error is the sharper rule and is worth
having verbatim: they had not grepped a stale worktree — they **re-quoted a
three-day-old grep without re-running it**. So the rule is not "pull first", it
is **re-run the grep; never quote old output.**

And the flip side, which matters just as much: **the report was still worth
having.** It found a real bug that eleven-twelfths of players would have seen.
Wrong details on a true finding is a good trade — say so when you correct
someone, or you will get fewer reports.

And the one that is not about collisions: **a detached run's log will look
EMPTY for a long time even when the run is healthy**, because node
block-buffers to a file. `ps aux | grep [s]uite.mjs` is how you tell "still
running" from "died"; an empty log is not evidence of either. (`script -q`
gives it a pty and restores line buffering if you would rather watch it.)

## THERE IS NO PAUSE (Matt, 2026-08-20) — a ruling, and why it is one

> "Remove the pause button tho. It's against the spirit of the game."

A pause was built on 2026-08-19, off the strongest single line in the game's
first outside playtest: *"Meanwhile theres a clock ticking. PAUSE ANYONE? I'm
losing time here and I want to pay back my landlord!"* It shipped for one day
and the owner took it out again.

**He is right, and this is written down so nobody rebuilds it from that same
quote.** Ben was describing the game WORKING. The clock running while you read
the shop is not an omission, it is the cost of reading the shop — and it is the
same thing he was praising two days later when he said the secret sauce is
*"incomprehensible UI and punishing you for not understanding at pace"*. You
cannot keep the second sentence and fix the first with a pause button.

**The line this draws, and it is the line all onboarding work runs to:** a
player who cannot tell WHAT A BUTTON DOES is a bug to fix. A player who is
losing money while they work it out is the game. Tooltips, a help screen, a
visible hire and a legible income are all on the right side of it. Anything
that buys the player TIME is on the wrong side.

Removed: the `paused` state, the chip, its click band, and the space/`p` keys.
The speed chips slid back left into the room the chip had been given (>> at
203, >>> at 215, >>>> at 229; bands at 202/213/227). The scenario **"the clock
cannot be stopped: there is no pause, and no speed of zero"** pins the ruling
as a mechanism rather than a grep — there must be no pause STATE to flip and no
entry in `FF_SPEED` that stops time, and the clock is then checked to actually
run, so a pause shipped as "speed 0 by default" fails it.

## ONE WALLET PER CRAB (Matt, 2026-08-20) — shipped

> "I like the idea that each crab just has one wallet, and the owner gets all
> the money from their shops, that's how we work."

A shop used to keep a TILL separate from its owner's POCKET, and three bits of
code shuffled money between them. `till` is now an ACCESSOR onto the owner
crab's wallet: every call site keeps working and means one thing. The backing
number is used only while a lease has no living owner, and the money FOLLOWS
THE OWNER — the instant a lease has a crab, whatever is parked moves into their
pocket.

**What it caught on the way in**, none of which the suite was looking for:
- SUDSY's **$200 of seed capital had been stranded** behind her lease for the
  whole game while her wallet did the work.
- An owner **dying would have minted** their stale backing into the world.
- The **float was credited before the buyer owned the lease**, so on a crab's
  first shop it stranded and the buyer's wallet read short — a sale measured in
  that window looked like theft.
- The **seller was paid through a lease that had already moved**.

**THE SENTENCE THAT FIXES ALL OF IT, in the code and in the suite alike: NAME A
CRAB, NOT A LEASE.** Six scenarios were measuring `OWNERS[id].till` at exactly
the moment a sale moves the lease, so afterwards that record points at nobody
and reads as if the seller was never paid.

**Three claims had to change because they were only true with two accounts:**
a sale between two crabs is a straight TRANSFER (`buyerPaid === sellerGain`);
there is no separate OPENING TILL; and the day-off payroll claim is asserted
from the PAYROLL RECORD rather than a balance, because a till that is also a
pocket cannot tell a skipped wage from a sandwich.

**Two behaviour changes, consequences rather than faults:**
- **Peer owners are cash-rich** — their takings ARE their savings — so a
  vacated shop is bought the settlement it is listed. A failed business may
  rarely reach the market for the player.
- **A second shop does not make you its operator**: BRASS buys the showers and
  keeps working her hotel.

The frozen fingerprint was re-baselined LAST, after the other seven failures
were understood, and it is the proof this was an accounting change rather than
a behavioural one: **SUDSY 40 → 220 and REEF 27 → 196 with every other number
byte-identical.** Nobody traded differently.

## THE CULTURE OF THE CRAB PEOPLE (Matt, 2026-08-20) — the direction for CS3

CS4 is **pushed back**, deliberately, and CS3's remaining scope is named:

> "CS3 needs to be a full 'culture'; CS4 will be 'build your own cultureway' in
> ways I haven't gotten into yet. So we want a really complete crab island
> culture (with hints at neighboring cultures, for instance I happen to know
> that a lot of pigs live on the mainland, and pigs and crabs have a lot in
> common. This probably won't come up in CS3 though)."

**So the remaining work on CS3 is CULTURAL COMPLETENESS, not features.** The
question to ask of a proposal is no longer "does this add a system" but "does a
crab island feel like a place with its own way of doing things".

### CANON

- **The crab people are a REPRESENTATIVE CRABOCRACY.** (Matt, verbatim.) This
  is not decoration — it is the name of the thing POLLING DAY already models,
  and it means the office, the ballot, the purse and the count are the CENTRAL
  cultural institution rather than a side system. Anything that deepens how the
  town governs itself is on-brief.
- **...AND IT IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE NOT GODS.** (Matt, verbatim:
  *"it's local government, they're not gods."*) This is the constraint on every
  future crabocracy idea, and it is the one that will be tempting to break,
  because a mayor with more levers is easier to build than a mayor with better
  ones. The office already models this correctly and should keep doing so: ONE
  REMIT (the shelter — its roof and its pot), a purse the town votes on, a
  ballot that runs on paper and can run out of it, and NOTHING about hours,
  wages, prices or who works where. The drama comes from a small office with a
  real bill, not from an office that can reach into the shops.
  **Test for a proposal: could a real seaside town council do this?** Setting
  the levy, arguing about the soup, failing to pay the landlord, printing too
  few ballot papers — yes. Directing labour, fixing prices, overriding an
  owner — no, and that is CS4's "build your own cultureway" territory anyway.
- **THERE IS A MAINLAND, AND PIGS LIVE ON IT.** Pigs and crabs have a lot in
  common. The far shore already exists in pixels — hills behind hills, a light
  on the point, a scatter of blocks that comes on after dark — and the trade
  ledger already treats the town as a NODE that imports. That is the seam:
  neighbouring cultures are HINTED, through what arrives on the ferry and what
  can be seen across the water, never stated.
- **It probably will not come up in CS3.** Matt said so. So: hints, not
  characters. A pig does not get off the boat in this game.

### WHAT THIS DOES TO THE BACKLOG

- **The surf spot is HELD** — "not quite yet, but we will do it". Keep it; do
  not build it yet.
- **The rivalry stays as it is** — the player answers an offer, they do not
  invite one. Matt: "let's keep (3) the same for now."
- **CS4 is further off than the 2026-08-18 CLOSING ACT assumed.** That section
  said park new ideas as CS4 design material; the ideas to park now are
  "build your own cultureway" ones. Cultural depth for the crabs stays in CS3.

## SCREENSHOTS: THE HANDOFF (process, 2026-08-20)

`shots/` is gitignored, and it is staying that way — two of them were the
ENDING CARD, whole closing text and town-name reveal, sitting browsable in a
public repo. That was the right fix and it had an unintended cost nobody
noticed for a night: **agent screenshots stopped reaching the devlog at all.**
Five overnight branches delivered none, and two devlog entries were written
with no visuals — the writer shot their own or went without.

**THE RULE, and it belongs in every agent brief:** take shots into `shots/`
while you work, then **harvest the two or three that matter into
`devlog/img/`** — which IS tracked — commit them on your branch, and **list the
paths with a one-line caption in your final report.** The gitignore already
said this was the intent; it just was not in anybody's instructions.

    devlog/img/2026-08-20-<short-slug>.png

The caption is not decoration. "What it shows and why it is the shot that shows
it" is what lets somebody who was not there write about the work.

**The embargo applies to every image**: no ending card, and the town's name
must not appear in a screenshot.

**What is worth shooting**, learned the hard way: BEFORE AND AFTER of the same
view, same seed, one change apart, beats any number of representative single
frames — it is the only honest way to show that something changed. For a
systems fix with no visible face, the honest artefact is a chart or a table,
not a manufactured dramatic screen.

## POLLING DAY — VOTING IS AN ACTION (Matt, 2026-08-20, shipped)

> "voting is an action, polls have a closing time, and ballots are made and
> counted on paper"

### What was wrong with the first election

It was a **function call**. `runElection()` ran at settlement, every crab in
town voted their interest in one loop, in no time at all, and the result
existed the instant it was cast. That is a poll in the sense a weather
forecast is a poll: an aggregate of preferences nobody had to act on. Matt's
three clauses each name one of the frictions a real one has, and each is now a
mechanism with a scenario asserting the mechanism rather than a feeling.

### 1. THE VOTE IS AN ERRAND

There are tables (`POLL_PLACES`) on the promenade and at the pier head, and a
crab has to **walk to one**. It is gathered in `pickErrand` and scored through
the same detour machinery as a plate of food or a drink at the tap, so turnout
is geography and shifts rather than a number somebody picked. `civicUrge` is a
**ramp**, not a constant: for most of the day a vote is worth `VOTE_BASE` — a
thing you do if the table is on your way — and in the last `VOTE_URGE_HRS` it
climbs and crabs who have not got there start making a special trip. Capped
below `DIRE` (0.9) so nobody ever walks off a shift to vote.

**MEASURED on the shipped build, 24 polls across 6 seeds and 29 days:
turnout 82%.**

| by shift | | by trade | |
|---|---|---|---|
| M | 92% | shack | 92% |
| E | 92% | showers | 80% |
| D (off) | **89%** | hotel | 79% |
| D | **73%** | fishing | 78% |

**SHIFT PREDICTS TURNOUT. TRADE BARELY DOES.** By trade the spread is 78–92
and most of it is noise; by shift it is 73 against 92 and it is structural.
The crab who struggles is not a fisher or a shower attendant, it is **anybody
on the long D shift** — the owner-operator's 8:30-to-18:30 day, which the polls
(07:00–19:00) bracket by half an hour at each end.

**The two D rows are the proof, and they are the same crabs.** On a working day
they vote 73%; on a day off, 89%. Sixteen points of turnout is not who they
are, it is what their day is. And the D window derives from the shop's OPEN
HOURS, so **the hours sign is a lever the player already holds** — you can run
a business whose staff cannot reach a ballot box, and nobody will stop you or
mention it.

> **An earlier version of this table read 96/92/76/67 with fishing at 87%, and
> it is WRONG — do not cite it.** Those numbers came from a build whose tables
> stood at 684 and 1844; fixing a furniture collision moved both (see below)
> and the gradient moved with them. The shape survived every re-measure; the
> digits did not. Written out rather than quietly overwritten, because a
> superseded measurement that stays plausible is exactly how PLAN's illness
> figure survived long enough to be recommended as a fix.

### THE PROMENADE IS FULL, and it cost the fleet 17 points

Every x in this feature was measured against the town's own furniture, not
picked. Taking the occupied spans — houses, the shelter, the memorial, both
standpipes, the notice board, five shopfronts, three bus stops, the pier —
there is **not one 74px gap left on 2512px of coast**. The first cut put a
table at 684 under a 66px board and it printed **straight through the JOB
BOARD's sign**; the card sweeps do not cover the world, so nothing caught it
but a screenshot. (There is a world sweep now, and it caught the second
collision immediately.)

The fix has a price tag, which is the part worth remembering: a 44px board
forced the pier table 48px west of the rail to clear the pier tap's WATER
label, and **that cost the fishing fleet 17 points of turnout — 87% to 70%** —
because 48px is eight real seconds off the end of a shift that finishes thirty
minutes before the polls shut. Cutting the board to 40px bought the table its
place back at the rail. **Four pixels of signage was the difference between a
fisher voting and not.**

### TWO TABLES, and why — the measurement that changed the design

With a single box on the promenade, **seed 1337 polled TWO of eight**. Not
apathy: a map. A stop costs about a real second per 11px of walking, the town
is 2512px wide, the whole D-shift fishing fleet works 8:30–18:30 at the PIER
1200px away, and the polls shut at 19:00. A fisher could not have voted if they
had sprinted. **A structural bias nobody can act on is not a choice**, and this
game is about choices — so the box goes where the people are, twice, exactly
the idiom the two standpipes already use (`WATER_TAPS`). The PAPER is still one
supply for one election, so running out is still running out.

### 2. THE POLLS SHUT

`POLL_OPEN = 7:00`, `POLL_SHUT = 19:00`. The early opening is load-bearing: a
working crab's errand window closes 30 minutes before they leave the house, so
an owner-operator on the 8:30 D shift has **no daylight at all** between the
town opening at 8:00 and their own front door. Polls open early in real towns
for exactly this crab. The 19:00 close is the tension — the D-shift owner
finishing at 18:30 has half an hour and a walk.

The rule at the table is the one a returning officer uses: **standing there
when it shuts counts; turning up at one minute past does not.** A latecomer is
recorded in `ballotBox.late` and says so in their own diary.

### 3. THE BALLOTS ARE PAPER

Nominations close at the settlement the **night before** — you cannot print a
ballot paper without knowing whose names go on it — which gives the player's
decision to STAND a real deadline, called out on the HALL tab on the night it
bites. The office then orders one sheet per crab plus `BALLOT_SPARE`, at
`BALLOT_PRICE` each, **off the ferry, on the trade ledger** (`paper` joined
`IMPORTS`), out of the town fund through `fundRemit`. Same law as everything
else: nothing is conjured.

Three things had to be fixed before that worked, each one measured:

- **The purse must BUDGET for it** (`ballotBill` inside `fundNeed`), and **two
  nights out**, not one — RENTS is taken out of each house rent on its way past
  and DUES land with the ferry, so on the founding policy the fund's balance
  tonight is what last night's collection left. Before: *every seed, every
  week, "NO BALLOT PAPER"* — not because the town was poor but because nobody
  had asked for the money.
- **Paper comes BEFORE the soup.** The roof is statutory and so is the
  election; the pot is what the mayor CHOSE. A budget spends its obligations
  before its intentions. With the pot first, three seeds in four printed
  nothing, because an $8 bowl beat $2.25 of paper every time.
- **And if the purse is still short, the town PASSES THE HAT** (`whipRound`).
  This kills a real **ratchet**, and a scenario found it rather than a reading
  of the code: a town where everybody sleeps at the shelter pays no house rent,
  so a RENTS-funded office can never print ballots, so it can never hold the
  election that would move it off RENTS. This system's standing rule is that a
  town can vote itself into losing the shelter and then vote itself back out —
  *a corrective loop, never a ratchet*. The hat is the same movement the
  collection tin already makes (`fundTake` out of a named crab's live balance,
  audited), scoped to a statutory purchase of a few pennies. A town where
  NOBODY has `WHIP_KEEP` in their pocket still holds no election, which is the
  destitute case that failure was always meant to be about.

### AND THE COUNT IS BY HAND

`COUNT_MINS` a paper, in the order they went into the box. **The tally does not
exist until it is counted**: `cands[].votes` stays at zero all day while the
box fills, and the declaration comes on the promenade when the last paper is
read — so a town that votes for a new purse at teatime is trading under it by
nightfall (the office used to change hands at the settlement table, one day
later). `finishCount()` at settlement is the safety net for a town big enough
that its count runs past 20:00.

### What the player sees

In the world: a trestle, a box with a slot cut in the lid, and a board that
says one of the **five states** — not yet open, open with a pile of blanks you
can watch go down, open with the pile gone, being counted, declared. The pile
is **one pixel a sheet**, so "the paper is running out" is legible from the
boardwalk. The count is a second pile moving across the table.

On the HALL tab: the live box on polling day — who is on the paper, how many
have voted, how much paper is left, and the three ways a crab loses a vote,
each by name. **No running tally, deliberately.** The papers are face down
until the count; a live total would quietly undo the whole point.

### Balance

Baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16` **0/16, median day 12**; growth
`--buy chef,table --days 40 --seeds 8` **3/8**. Both unmoved. Suite 172 → 179.

### Left deliberately undone

**Nobody physically counts.** The count takes real time at the box, with a
visible pile, but there is no crab animated doing it — a returning officer who
had to walk there would need a fallback for being asleep, at work, or dead, and
that is a state machine for a detail. Flagged for Matt rather than hidden: if
he wants the count to be somebody's job too, it is a contained addition on top
of what is here.

## CANON: THERE IS ONE FERRY (Matt, 2026-08-19)

**Settled by Matt selecting option (a) from a two-option picker put to him by
the devlog session. He added no free text, so the choice is the whole of his
input — do not attribute prose about this to him.** The framing below is the
devlog session's, offered as a recommendation and ratified by that selection;
treat it as approved intent rather than his phrasing.

**(a) SAME BOAT — YOU BUY THE CROSSING.** The day boat that has been landing
tourists all game IS the ferry. Buying her means the town buys the crossing it
has always depended on: the tourists' money paid for the boat that brings the
tourists. The ending card already says exactly this ("You did not buy a way
out. You bought the crossing, and a crossing runs both ways"). The freighter
and the Thursday crossing stay as **other people's traffic**.

What that forced in code (2026-08-19, same day):
- **ONE HULL.** `drawMooredFerry` is DELETED. It drew a bespoke 116px white
  hull at `PIER_X0 - 30`, on the winning frame only — a second vessel, in a
  different place, from the one the player watches four times a day. The win
  now draws the SAME `FERRY_ART` sprite at the SAME berth (`FERRY.hull`), and
  `drawFerry` simply keeps drawing when `won` (she stays; she is yours).
- **HER NAME GOES ON AT THE WIN.** The label is `won ? "CRABALINA" : "FERRY"` —
  a timetable name while she is somebody else's, her own name once she is not.
  This is also the embargo's reveal moment, so the two rules agree.
- **THE CAMERA GOES TO HER**, not to a spot on the pier she is not at:
  `camX = clampCam(FERRY.hull - W / 2 + 14)`.
- **THE FAR-CHANNEL BOAT MUST NOT READ AS HER.** Under (a) yours is alongside
  your own pier four times a day, so the Thursday crossing is the mainland's
  own traffic: longer, darker, and **masted where yours has a funnel**, so the
  two can never be confused at a glance across the water.
- Receipt: scenario **"the ferry is ONE boat: the day boat and the win are the
  same hull"** — asserts `drawMooredFerry` no longer exists, that she is
  unnamed before the win and named after, that the winning camera is looking at
  her berth, and that the far-channel crossing carries no text at all.

## UX BUG — selling to an NPC is undiscoverable (Matt, 2026-08-20)
Matt, playing: "we need to make selling to an NPC more intuitive... I saw
that an NPC was interested but couldn't sell." He is not missing a step —
**there is nothing to click during EYEING.** What the code actually does:
- The player CANNOT initiate a sale. There is no "list my business". The
  only sale path is ACCEPTING a rival's offer.
- `rival.stage` runs none → eyeing → offer → compete → done. During
  **eyeing** she is still saving; the manage line reads "X IS EYEING THE
  BAR — CAN RAISE $N OF $M" and no accept affordance exists anywhere.
- She only offers when she can raise ≥ `LOWBALL` (0.35) of what it's
  worth. Then a toast says "TAP ITS SIGN", and TAKE / NO chips appear at
  y=133 on **the prize business's own shopfront sign** (`rivalChipRects`).
So the player sees interest for days with no way to act, and when the
offer does land the affordance is a shopfront sign, not the management
screen they're already looking at.
**Worse, there is a trap**: she banks the offer out of her SHOWERS till,
and a successful player juice bar next door collapses that till from
$150-220 to $0-45 (measured, in RIVAL_CFG's own comment). Run the bar well
and she may NEVER afford it — "EYEING" becomes a permanent state with no
feedback saying so.
FIX DIRECTION (UX agent): make the state legible and the action reachable.
At minimum, say what is actually true — "EYEING — CANNOT AFFORD IT YET,
HAS $N OF $M" and, when she can't close the gap, say that. Put the
accept/refuse action on the management screen as well as the sign, since
that is where an owner goes to do owner things. Consider whether the
player should be able to invite an offer at all (a real "FOR SALE" listing
by the owner) — that is a design question for Matt, not a UX patch.

## SPOILER EMBARGO — the town's name (Matt, 2026-08-19)
Matt: "don't put the town's name out there, it's going to be a cheeky
reveal near the end." The name renders in exactly two places, both in the
winning frame: the ferry's hull as she comes alongside, and the ending
card. Everywhere else the game says TO THE MAINLAND / THE PIER / THE
FERRY / "YOUR TOWN - SLOT N".
RULE: DEVLOG.md must never name the town, and no screenshot of the ending
card may be published. Write around it — "the far shore", "the mainland",
"somewhere else". The player is never told where they live; they work it
out from being able to see the other side. (Coordinator verifies with a
grep before every devlog push.)

## CLOSING ACT — CS3 is feature-complete (Matt, 2026-08-18)
Matt, verbatim: "I feel spiritually that once this stuff rolls and is
quality crab shack 3 will be complete. Crab shack 4 we will work on the
design for tomorrow."

POSTURE: **quality, not features.** All agents have landed; the day closed
at 23 merges, suite 82/82 (independently re-run green by the coordinator
session). Do NOT open new CS3 feature fronts — park new ideas as CS4
DESIGN MATERIAL. The unbuilt trade-horizon items (T3 sourcing, T5 exports
and sibling nodes) plus business settings, more peer owners, the
player-avatar crab, staff-bused service and NPC eviction are the CS4 seed
bed, not a CS3 backlog. The devlog capstone (73f209c) closes the serial.

REOPENED BY DIRECTIVE (2026-08-19): Matt watched his town and filed a fault
— *"sudsy goes bankrupt every day.. the shop needs to close till some crab
can buy it then, rite?"* — which is a QUALITY complaint about a zombie, not
a new front. Business failure / FOR SALE / succession landed against it (see
the feature entry above), alongside a free public water tap and NPC
mortality from sibling agents.

## DEFERRED TO CS4 (decided 2026-08-18, not forgotten)
Both belonged to Matt's "all crabs should be equal" directive, and both were
deferred deliberately as design questions rather than bugs:
- **NPC mortality** — NPCs still cannot die (the `!k.p.npc` guard in the
  settlement illness block). Also why a sick NPC can linger indefinitely.
  **Seam ready (2026-08-19)**: whoever lands mortality does NOT need to touch
  the owner layer. `runSuccession()` sweeps at every settlement — a business
  whose owner is no longer in `allCrabs()` goes on the market with reason
  "gone" instead of being orphaned, and the same buyers turn up for it.
- **Wage asymmetry** — NPC_WAGE 20 vs CRAB_WAGE 23.
These are the last places the sim treats some crabs as more real than
others. Tomorrow is the day for that.
- ~~**NPC mortality**~~ — **REOPENED BY MATT AND SHIPPED 2026-08-19** ("we do
  need to make death an option in such cases"). See the public-taps entry
  below: the `!k.p.npc` guard is gone and every crab is mortal.
- ~~**Wage asymmetry**~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-08-19** with the wage setting below.
  NPC_WAGE is retired; wages are per-business data and a business pays what it
  pays whoever works there. The 20 survives only as SUDS SHOWERS' OPENING rate
  — a fact about her shop, not about the crabs in it — and her own wage policy
  walks it up to the town's $23 within a fortnight of her first hire.

## PUBLIC TAPS + UNIVERSAL MORTALITY (shipped 2026-08-19, worktree)
Matt, from play, two sentences that turned out to be one job: **"some crabs
just never drink, that must be a bug"** and **"we do need to make death an
option in such cases."** A town where a crab cannot meet a need has no
business making that need fatal, so both halves land in one measured pass:
the ENVIRONMENT first, then the stakes.

### THE FAULT — three traps of the same shape
`pickErrand` let a crab drink only at a **STAFFED** counter, and the
self-serve fallback was gated `!c.p.npc`. SUDSY works 8:30–18:30 — exactly
the hours the counters are staffed — so she is never free while a vendor is
open; the fishers hold the rail all day for the same reason; and as townsfolk
neither may pour their own. Same class as the trap weekends fixed (crabs
couldn't use facilities that closed during their shift).

Measured, seed 5, 12 days, `pickErrand` instrumented — parched errand checks
vs how many of them had a drink on offer:

| crab | parched checks | a drink available | drinks in 12 days |
|---|---|---|---|
| SUDSY (owner-operator) | 73 | 8 (11%) | 4 |
| SALTY (fisher) | 293 | 10 (3%) | 7 |
| DRIFT (fisher) | 157 | 7 (4%) | 7 |
| SCUTTLE (drifter) | 13 | **0** | **0. Ever.** |

Two more of the same shape found en route, both pre-existing:
- **THE SHOWER ATTENDANT COULD NEVER SHOWER.** The bath was gated on
  `c.workBiz !== "showers"`, and `workBiz` is set at clock-in and NEVER
  CLEARED — so SUDSY was barred from her own stalls for life. Measured: 161
  of 161 grubby errand checks blocked by that field, 0 baths in 12 days, dirt
  pinned at 1.00 (−6% pace, −30% on every tip, +0.06 sickness a night). Now
  scoped to actually being ON DUTY, which is all the gate ever meant.
- **THE EVENING QUEUE NEVER REACHES THE LOCAL** — *not fixed, flagged.* SUDSY
  can afford food on 35 of 35 hungry errand checks, but the shack is dark on
  28 of them and on the other 7 she joins the line at 18:30 and leaves
  UNSERVED at 20:45 / 21:03 / 22:26. Measured on the pre-pass build too (one
  meal in eight days), so it is not this pass's doing. **This is the next
  instance of the class** and the reason the mortality model below refuses to
  execute a crab on day three of a cared-for illness.

### THE TAP (the environmental fix)
Two public standpipes — `WATER_TAPS`, one on the promenade beside the notice
board (x640) and one at the foot of the pier (x1844), where a fisher hoses
down the catch. Free, always on, no queue, no staff, no till, no shop hours.
A stop in `pickErrand` that every crab can reach: crew, townsfolk,
owner-operators, fishers. Its own tiny `dayState` ("atTap"), so nothing in the
customer pipeline has to learn about a stop that never pays anybody.

**The juice bar keeps its business by construction, three ways:**
1. **First refusal.** `TAP_AT` **0.70** sits ABOVE the drink errand's own 0.45,
   so the whole 0.45–0.70 band belongs to the counters. You'd buy a juice when
   you fancy one; you walk to the standpipe when you're properly thirsty.
2. **Plain water.** `TAP_QUENCH` 0.6 off the meter, where any juice ZEROES it —
   a bought drink buys about twice the runway, and a COOLER is still a treat.
3. **A real stop.** `TAP_SIP` 3.2s at the spout, `TAP_APPEAL` 0.5 halving its
   pull in the errand score, `TAP_CD` 20 cooldown after a sip.

**THE STANDPIPE RINSE** — the safety net, not a free shower. Cold water, no
soap: `TAP_RINSE` −0.35 against a $5 rinse's −0.5, at `TAP_RINSE_AT` **0.85**
(0.66 while ill — the CARED bar), and offered ONLY to a crab the market cannot
serve right now: nobody on the stalls, no fare in pocket, or they ARE the
attendant. A crab who could walk into a staffed shower with the fare in hand
never sees it, so SUDSY's takings do not pay for the fix.

**Measured, 6 seeds × 14 days, full town (bar + arcade + 5 crew), before → after:**

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| PARCHED (thirst ≥ 0.8, the −15% walk) | 7.2% | **1.3%** |
| at the dehydration sickness line (≥ 0.95) | 6.28% | **0.88%** |
| worst unbroken parched streak | **6.3 days** | **0.9 days** |
| mean dirt, town-wide | 0.670 | **0.523** |
| infections | 21 | **11** |
| **JUICE BAR takings** | **$14,347** | **$15,386 (+7.2%)** |
| shack takings | $27,092 | $27,435 |
| SUDS SHOWERS takings | $2,758 | $3,665 (+33% — she finally washes) |

The bar goes UP, not down: a hydrated town walks faster and shops more. Tourist
drinks were always ~88% of its trade, and tourists don't use taps.

### UNIVERSAL MORTALITY
The `!k.p.npc` guard in the settlement illness block is gone. Same odds off the
same `CARE_LANES`, byte-for-byte, so looking after somebody is worth exactly
what it was worth. What makes it FAIR is **when the roll arms**:

    NEGLECT lane      DEATH_DAY  4   (hungry >= 0.5 or dirty >= 0.66 while ill)
    any lane above it LINGER_DAY 7   (fed, watered, clean — the tide has to wait)

A crab dies of a neglect somebody could have fixed. A crab who is being looked
after is not taken on day three, ever — which is what keeps the care ladder
worth climbing now that everyone is mortal, and which is the honest answer to
the evening-queue trap above (a crab starving at the back of a line it cannot
reach is not a fair execution).

**LEGIBLE — the town sees it coming.** The settlement before the roll arms
names the crab: a `FADING` mood on the follow card, `GRAVELY ILL - DAY N` on
the status line and the dossier's HEALTH row, a "GRAVELY ILL" pop over their
shell, a named toast, and a **day-report line** ("SALTY IS FADING - NEEDS
CARE") beside the existing died / fell ill / recovered lines. Then the memorial.

**Measured, 12 solvent towns × 30 days:** 9 deaths (0.75/town), **8 of 9 on the
NEGLECT lane**, illnesses running 4–9 days before the end. Crew 0, townsfolk 9
— a solvent player's crew eat and wash, which is the ladder paying out; crew
mortality itself is unchanged and suite-pinned. In the true do-nothing baseline
(16 seeds × 30d) there is exactly **one** death all told, so mortality is not
what moved the eviction curve.

**CONSEQUENCES the town feels.** A dead owner-operator shutters the shop
(`OWNERS[id].gone`, which `bizDark` reads and the settlement skips; persisted),
her staff go back to the pier rather than draw wages from a till nobody keeps,
and her postings come off the job board. **SEAM, deliberately left:** proper
succession belongs to the bankrupt-shop ownership-transfer work happening in
parallel — `gone` is the flag to hang it on. A dead fisher frees their place on
the rail: `freeFishSpot()` takes the lowest spot nobody holds, where
`fishSpotFor(count)` used to hand a newcomer a spot somebody was standing on.
The dead stay dead across save/load — `initNpcs()` stands the founders up
BEFORE `load()` runs, so the saved persona list is now the roll of the living
and anybody missing from it is in the memorial row.

**Cosmetic, found while shooting it:** the memorial row was laid out westward
from the shelter at a 16px pitch, which since all nine lots stood permanently
put headstones inside the front rooms of houses 4 and 5. Moved to the dune
between the last promenade lot and the town tap, two to a row, DERIVED from the
index (old saves relocate), grounded, and each marker now carries its name.

### Balance (30 days, `--jobs`)
- **Baseline 8 seeds: 0/8, evictions 13,14,14,14,15,15,16,18, median 15**
  (before: 0/8, 11–16, median 14). Lose-by-default holds; +1 median, +2 tail.
- Baseline 16 seeds: 1/16, median 14 (before 0/16, median 13). One seed now
  reaches day 30.
- Growth `--buy chef,table` 40d × 8: **3/8 alive** (before 4/8).
- The move is the TAP, not the deaths, and its mechanism is measured: crabs
  spend ~20% more of their existence clocked in (dutyFrac 0.27 → 0.33) because
  they are not walking at −15% and not losing shifts to illness. Same shape as
  the routing pass's recovered crab-hours. TAP_AT was swept against the matrix
  — 0.45 measured 5/16 surviving, 0.55 worse, 0.65 3/16, **0.70 1/16** — and
  0.70 is where the fix is complete (0.9-day worst parched streak) AND the
  curve holds. Lower it and the town gets measurably richer; that is the knob,
  and it is documented rather than hidden.

### Suite 82 → 87
New: the anti-trap gate (nobody parched for a week, crew AND townsfolk), the
tap's free-and-reachable + juice-bar revenue floor, neglect kills a crew crab
AND a townsfolk crab (with the warning, the memorial and the report line), a
cared-for crab is not taken on day three, and a dead NPC leaves the town sane
(shop shut, no orphaned rail spot, save/load clean). **All five verified RED on
the pre-pass build**, the behavioural two for the right reason ("a crab spent
3.1 days straight in the parched band: SUDSY (town)@9"; "SUDSY never died").

Two re-pointings, receipts in the scenarios:
1. `hours: defaults are behavior-identical (frozen day-2 fingerprint)` — seed
   1337 is BYTE-IDENTICAL except SUDSY, who moves from (743.8, 167.6), still
   out on the boardwalk at midnight, to (388, 154), asleep at home. Seed 4242
   shows the trade in one line: she drinks free water instead of buying, so her
   wallet holds 40 instead of 18 and the player's till is $19 lighter.
2. `auto-manage: grants a sick day` — the FIXTURE, not the rule. It demanded
   the grant at the FIRST settlement, which only worked while the crab reliably
   failed that night's cure roll (the illness block runs before runLaborPolicy
   in the same frame). A hydrated town cures faster.

**Note for `tools/illness.mjs`:** its BED/COT arms now record 0 deaths in both
paired arms (they were 4 and 4 of 120). That is the linger rule by
construction, not a regression — those arms hold a crab on a rest lane all the
way through, and rest lanes no longer arm the roll before day 7.

### Devlog beat (organic, reproducible — seed 1337, SUDSY)
`node tools/headless.mjs --days 12 --seeds 1`.
**Before:** from day 3 she is pinned at hunger 1.00, thirst 1.00, dirt 1.00,
wallet $0, ill six straight days on the NEGLECT lane and still ill on day 12 —
the zombie Matt was reacting to. Over twelve days `pickErrand` hands her
NOTHING 463 times and a meal once; she sets off for the shack, waits in the
line to 21:55, and never gets home to bed.
**After:** she eats on day 4 and day 7, drinks at the town tap, hoses off at
the standpipe five times, and her dirt oscillates 0.45–0.85 instead of pinning.
When she does fall ill on day 7 she is NEGLECT for one night — then gets
herself fed, watered and clean and reaches **BED REST** on day 8, where the
roll cures her at the improved 0.55 lane. She is back on her stalls on day 9,
and she sleeps at home every night. Shots: `tap-drinking`, `tap-night`,
`tap-pier`, `fading-dossier`, `death-report`, `memorial-townsfolk`.

## SICK CRABS COULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE (Matt, 2026-08-19)

Matt: *"I feel like sick crabs dont get food or clean or anything; seems like a
problem."* Right, and worse than the report: mean hunger while ill ran **0.799
against 0.534 well**, and a sick crab spent **47.3% of its illness at or above
0.95 hunger**. Neither cause was in the sickness rules, and both were found by
instrumenting REFUSALS rather than reading code.

**CAUSE 1 — SHIPPED FIX. A sick day was being treated as a shift.** `off`
deliberately excludes illness, so an ill crab does not inherit a day-off crab's
loose *spending* thresholds — they are not on holiday. But `off` also fed the
errand WINDOW, so a crab at home ill was treated as mid-shift and could not
leave the house between the morning commute and the end of a shift they were
not working. Measured: **83 of 137** refusals for a starving sick crab at home,
and **not one ever passed**. Fixed with `ownTime = off || sick`, which opens the
window and leaves the thresholds alone. On its own this reads **3/8 growth**.
Receipt: scenario *"a sick day is not a shift: an ill crab can leave the
house"*. It re-baselined the frozen day-2 fingerprint — DRIFT is ill on day 2
of seed 1337 and now walks to eat instead of sitting at home starving.

**CAUSE 2 — BUILT, MEASURED, THEN DELIBERATELY HELD BACK.** There is no free
FOOD anywhere the way the taps are free water, and a sick day pays nothing. The
most useful number in the investigation: of every tick where a sick, hungry
crab could not buy food, **1800 were NPCs and ZERO were the player's crew** —
it is the TOWNSFOLK who starve, because they have no wage coming in. And every
crab who starved right through an illness worked at the **showers or the
hotel**, while every **fisher** was fine: a fisher roasts their own catch.

A SHELTER POT was built for it (a tap-shaped stop at `SHELTER_X + 10`, 0.45 of
relief for 11 minutes, sick crabs only, offered last). It worked — mean hunger
while ill **0.434**, starving share **13.8%**, growth **2/8 + 2/8** — and it is
**NOT IN THE BUILD**, because Matt caught the real problem with it:

> *"Sorry do we have some kind of communal food pot? We are going to need a
> charity system, these resources don't come from nowhere. Same thing for rent
> on the shelter."*

He is right and it is the same rule this game applies everywhere else (visitor
wallets are minted and destroyed so nothing inflates; every import is on the
ledger). **Free food from nowhere is not allowed.** The pot returns FUNDED,
under the mayor — see the next section. The working code is parked at
`scratchpad/game-with-pot.js`.

Worth keeping from the measurement work: **the two halves interact**. Window
fix alone 3/8; pot alone 3/8; both with the pot open to everyone **1/8 + 1/8**,
because the player's own crew stopped buying plates and queued at the shelter.
Restricting it to the ill gave back nearly all of it AND fed the ill *better*
(0.434 vs 0.514), because the well keep the counters busy. Whatever funds the
pot later, that lesson stands: a free option open to everyone competes with the
counter, and the counter is where the town's money is.

## THE MAYOR, THE TOWN FUND AND ELECTIONS (Matt, 2026-08-19) — NEXT

Matt's direction, verbatim: *"We are going to need a charity system, these
resources don't come from nowhere. Same thing for rent on the shelter.
Unfortunately this means a new mayor character and elections. So far they just
manage the homeless shelter… yeah this will be a whole thing but it shouldn't
be too bad eh! Little top hat and all."*

Two design questions were put to him as a picker, and his answers shape the
whole feature:
- **Where the money comes from: "This is exactly the choice the mayor will
  make."** The funding MECHANISM is not a constant — it is the office's policy
  lever, and therefore what an election is actually about. A levy on
  businesses, a collection tin, a cut of Pincherton's rents, harbour dues on
  every visitor the ferry lands: a mayor picks, and the town lives with it.
- **The player can STAND AND WIN.** With the conflict of interest that comes
  with it: set the levy and you pay it too.

The office's remit, for now, is the homeless shelter: its **rent** and its
**pot**. If the fund runs dry, the pot goes cold and the shelter's crabs sleep
rough — which is already a modelled state with real consequences (`sleepRough`,
reputation, illness), so the failure mode costs something the player can feel.

## THE SELF-HEALING RULE (Matt, 2026-08-19) — read before adding any free cure
Matt: "I appreciate the self healing stuff but I feel it breaks the economy. I
think deficiency should encourage player intervention but have some potential
for auto resolution, just make it difficult." That is now the standing rule for
every free cure in the game:

  A crab can always claw its way out of a deficiency alone, but the way out
  costs TIME and never money. It stops a death spiral; it never pays the rent.
  A crab living at the tap is a crab not working - a cost the player feels
  without a coin moving.

The tap was the first thing measured against it and it FAILED: at threshold
0.70 / quench 0.6 / sip 3.2s the town got healthy enough that 2 of 16
do-nothing towns survived 30 days. Retuned to a genuine last resort - threshold
0.72 (you'd buy at 0.45), quench 0.5 (a mouthful, not a drink, so they're back
within the hour), sip 6s of the working day, appeal 0.35 - and lose-by-default
came back to 0/16 (median 15) with growth still escaping 4/8 and BOTH fairness
gates green (nobody parched for a week, the juice bar still sells).
A first attempt at 0.82/0.42/7.5s overshot: a townsfolk crab went 10 days
without a drink. That is the shape of the dial - too generous breaks the
economy, too mean breaks the fairness the tap exists to provide.

Apply this rule to the beach forage and any free-fun cure before building them.

**Applied, and the receipt is in the entry below**: the boredom pass was
measured against exactly this rule. Its ONLY free cure is a conversation, which
costs two crabs 40-64 game-minutes of the working day and cannot keep them
topped up on its own - and the owner's "no fun till arcade" ruling means there
is nothing else.

## NEEDS THAT FAIL IN THEIR OWN CHARACTER (shipped 2026-08-19, worktree)
Boredom **drifts**, tiredness **stalls**. Builds `design/needs-failure-patterns.md`
B1 + B3 and TI1 + TI4 — the owner's picks: *"Dirt boredom and tiredness are good"*.

Until this pass all five needs failed the same way: the bar filled, `crabEff`
shaved a few percent, and at 0.95 a flat number joined a sickness roll. Parched
and bored looked identical from the boardwalk. Two of them now have a VERB.

### THE OWNER'S TWO RULINGS, and both are load-bearing
1. **"No fun till arcade is part of the game for now, it's fun."** The design
   doc recommended a FREE FUN environmental fix (pier rail, tide line, busker).
   **Rejected.** There is no free-fun venue, no ambient boredom decay and no
   solo cure. The town visibly drifting until you can afford the $650 CLAWCADE
   IS the pressure to buy one.
2. **"Can do the social thing tho when bored, since it's very costly for
   efficiency; I like that. Might make game much harder."** So CHATTER is in —
   not as a freebie but *because* it is expensive. That makes it the model case
   for THE SELF-HEALING RULE rather than an exception to it: the way out costs
   TIME and never money, and it never pays the rent.

**THE CURE LEDGER.** Boredom has exactly two cures and neither is free: the
**ARCADE** (money — instant and total, `bored = 0`) and a **CONVERSATION**
(time — 40–64 game-minutes stood still, for 0.06 off the bar). A crab with
nobody to talk to — the lone shower attendant, the fisher on the far rail — has
no way down at all, which is the loneliness shape the doc wanted. And a pair
**cannot keep itself topped up**: `CHAT_CD` allows at most two chats in a
trading day at `CHAT_RELIEF` 0.06, against a worked shift's **+0.20**. Measured:
a solvent arcade-less town still sits at **mean boredom 0.832** over 24 days of
chatter (0.857 with the chatter off). The cure takes the edge off; nothing more.

### BOREDOM — DRIFT
- **IDLE HANDS (the wander-off).** A crab on shift with no order to claim and no
  dirty stall stops loitering by the door and takes itself to the tide line, the
  sea wall, the notice board, the pier rail or the arcade window it cannot
  afford (`WANDER_SPOTS`, filtered to `WANDER_PX` **340** of their post, every
  spot through `clearSpotY`). **Still clocked in** — `kstate` stays `"idle"` and
  the claim scan runs every frame, so a guest landing costs exactly the walk
  back and nothing else.
  What keeps it CHARMING at saturation (boredom is 0.72–0.85 town-wide with
  everyone touching 1.0, so this fires constantly by design): `WANDER_AT`
  **0.6**; the counter must be DEAD for `WANDER_QUIET` **3s** first, so nobody
  bolts the instant the queue empties; and a wander is a **trip**, not a
  posting — `WANDER_DWELL` **14–24s** stood there, then back to the post, then
  `WANDER_CD` **20s** before the next. A six-hour shift is only 90 REAL seconds,
  so those three numbers are what set the share of a dead spell spent off post:
  about half. Plus **RULE 3 — boredom yields to everybody** (`boredYields`,
  `BORED_YIELD` 0.8 on hunger / thirst / tiredness). Dirt is deliberately NOT in
  that list: dirt is passive and always-on (Rule 2) and the town sits near 0.7
  forever, so including it would switch the whole pattern off.
  Measured cost: the 8-seed baseline reads median 12 **with** it and median 12
  **without** (lifetime $30,224 vs $31,319) — inside the documented per-build
  wobble. It is nearly free, and it lands hardest exactly when the shop is
  quiet, which is when it costs the town least.
- **THE WALK-OUT (B3, the late stage).** Pinned past `WALKOUT_AT` **0.95** at
  `WALKOUT_DAYS` settlements running and the crab takes an unauthorised day: no
  commute, no shift, **NO WAGE**, and **nobody covering**, because nobody was
  told. Announced by name the night before — toast plus a day-report line,
  "PINCHY HAS HAD ENOUGH - OFF TOMORROW" — so it is a thing the player could
  have prevented.
  `awayToday()` is the single predicate every downstream rule reads: the commute
  gate, the beach amble, `pickErrand`'s relaxed thresholds (so a crab who walked
  out of boredom will absolutely spend the day at the arcade, if the town has
  one), `crabDueTonight`, both wage loops, and `bizRestingToday`. **`offToday()`
  stays the ROTA and nothing else**, because the cover-shift promotion keys on
  it and NOBODY COVERS A WALK-OUT. The job board is untouched by construction:
  its emergency HELP WANTED gate counts roster HEADCOUNT, not who clocked in.
  The shopfront gets a third placard, **NOBODY CAME IN**, beside DAY OFF and
  OUT SICK.
  **`WALKOUT_DAYS` ships at 4, not the doc's 2, and that is measured.** The doc
  wrote 2 assuming a free-fun venue would exist to bring the bar down. It
  doesn't: boredom PINS at 1.00 by about day 5 and never falls, so a threshold
  of 2 makes the late stage the *steady state* — every crab losing every third
  day forever, which is a paywall rather than pressure. At 2 the 8-seed baseline
  took **48 walk-outs and the eviction median fell 17 → 11**; at 4 it takes 26
  and lands at 12. Four means a bored crew loses roughly one extra day a week —
  visible, expensive, survivable, and it stops the day you buy the arcade.
- **CHATTER.** `CHAT_AT` 0.55 on BOTH parties, within `CHAT_PX` 26, neither
  carrying / claimed / holding a slot / in a queue / under a player order;
  `CHAT_SECS` 10–16 real seconds, `CHAT_RELIEF` 0.06 each, `CHAT_CD` 360
  game-minutes. Its own `runChatter()` pass over the crab list — **deliberately
  NOT folded into `collide()`**, which belongs to the locomotion layer. A chat
  takes its own `dayState "chat"` and stops the day dead: not the schedule, not
  the kitchen, not the commute. That is the price, and it is the whole reason
  the cure is allowed to exist at all.
  One gate found by reading a log rather than a matrix: **nobody strikes up a
  conversation in their sleep.** Two shelter cots 26px apart were chatting at
  04:30, which reads as a bug however good the arithmetic is. Chat is now
  refused to a crab who is HOME and in the dark; the walk home still counts,
  because that is exactly when two crabs fall into step. It cost real balance
  (chats 237 → 140 across the 8-seed baseline, eviction median 15 → 12) and it
  was still right.

### TIREDNESS — STALL
- **THE MICROSLEEP (TI1).** Past `NOD_AT` **0.85**, timed work has a `NOD_RATE`
  **0.05**/second chance to stop dead for 2–5 seconds: eyes shut, the existing
  sleep pose, the existing Z drift, the prep bar frozen mid-taco, then a jolt
  awake ("WHAT? I'M UP"). The crab **KEEPS THE STATION SLOT** — `release()` is
  not called and `workT` does not tick — so the cost lands on the whole kitchen
  and not just the sleeper. Only in `NOD_STATES` (walk / toSlot / work /
  toStallClean / cleaningStall): never `idle`, where a nod would cost nobody
  anything, and never `waitSlot`/`waitCash`, which hold nothing.
- **THE SHORTCUT HOME (TI4, the late stage).** Past `ROUGH_AT` **0.97**, with
  more than `ROUGH_PX` 250 of the walk home left and the light gone, a
  `ROUGH_RATE` **0.03**/second roll beds them down where they stand. Sleeping
  rough banks **NO** repair — bed 0.4–0.5/h, cot 0.2–0.25/h, street 0 — so
  exhaustion prevents its own cure. Honest and frightening, and nothing
  "punished" the crab: they just didn't make it home.
  It is a ROLL rather than a cliff for a measured reason. A flat rule dropped
  every exhausted crab the instant they left the shack (home is always further
  than 250px from a counter), which made it a one-way ratchet with no exit but
  the weekly rota day: **94 rough nights per 6 towns × 15d**, against **18** as
  a roll, and the probe town's mean tiredness fell 0.373 → 0.215 with the change.
  Escapable by exactly the levers the player already has — a day off, a
  right-click knock-off order, a shorter shift — and suite-pinned as such.
  `careLane` was checked and deliberately left alone: it reads the housing RUNG
  and DAYLIGHT rest hours, never position, so a rough night proves nothing on
  the care ladder either way. That is the right answer, not an oversight.

**TIREDNESS IS A GROWTH-TOWN PRESSURE, and the numbers say so loudly.** Nothing
accrues tiredness *during* a shift — `TIRED_SHIFT` lands as a step at knock-off
— so the only way to be past 0.85 while actually mid-task is to have arrived
that way. Measured share of STATION time at each band (4 seeds × 12d, 4 crew): a
plain town spends **0.0%** above *every* band from 0.5 up; an all-overtime town
spends **2.3%** at ≥ 0.85. So the microsleep lands on one badly-run crab at a
time — and for THAT crab, whose whole station day is eligible, `NOD_RATE` 0.05
works out at ~4 nods that day, which is the design doc's 2–5/crew-day target
hitting the crab it is actually about. Town-wide it reads 0.04–0.06
nods/crew-day and **~0.2% of station time** (the brief's ceiling was ~5%), and
in the 8-seed BASELINE matrix it fires **zero times** — the "no nod" arm is
byte-identical to the shipped one.
**Auto-manage measurably protects a delegated town**, and this was verified
rather than assumed: same probe, rough nights **18 with auto-manage OFF vs 4
with it ON**, mean tiredness 0.215 vs 0.144 — because `LABOR_CFG` pulls a crab
off overtime at tired **0.75, below the nod line**. That is the auto-manage
feature finally having a visible payoff.

### The watchdogs, and why none of them fight this
A napping, chatting or rough-sleeping crab **never calls `stepTo`**, and the
auto-unstick watchdog's `walking` test requires `c._stepped` — so the 1.5s
sidestep and the 30-game-minute `BOUNCE_BUDGET` warp both look straight past all
three by construction. `updateStuck` says it out loud anyway, because a sidestep
mid-nap would shove a crab off the station it is holding. The suite's freeze
detector samples `dayState` in `["toWork","toHome","toErrand"]` and `kstate` in
`["walk","toSlot","toBus","toSink"]`: `kstate "nap"` and `dayState "chat"` are
in neither list, which is *why* they were given their own states instead of a
flag on the old ones.
**No deadlock.** The nap is hard-capped at `NOD_MIN + NOD_SPAN`, and a coworker
who wants the station sits in `waitSlot` **in the clear lane** polling
`tryAcquire` — the hold-and-wait fix this project already made. Suite-pinned
with a `waitSlot`-run tripwire on a kitchen held at exhaustion for four days.
And **`abortChef` now wakes a sleeper**: without it the guard would keep
returning early forever on a crab whose station had already been released — the
exact shape of the stall-occupant leak `abortErrand` exists to fix.
`abortActivity` ends a chat unpaid and puts a rough sleeper back on their feet;
`killCrab` ends a chat too.

### Balance — measured, attributed, and NOT tuned away
**Read this table as the two patterns' OWN attribution**: it was measured
before THE SLEEP DIRECTIVES (below) landed on top of them, which is exactly why
it is worth keeping — it is the only place the patterns are isolated from the
tiredness retune. **The shipped curve is the one in the sleep-directives
section: baseline 0/8 median 13, 0/16 median 12, growth 5/8.**
Every arm is the same 8 seeds through the same harness with only
`window._failOff` different, so each movement can be blamed on one thing.
**`ALL OFF` reproduces the pre-pass build's eviction list exactly**
(11,14,14,15,17,17,18,20, median 17) — the receipt that nothing else moved.

| baseline 30d × 8 | alive | eviction days | median | lifetime | serves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ALL OFF** (= the pre-pass build) | 0/8 | 11,14,14,15,17,17,18,20 | **17** | $40,810 | 2165 |
| no walk-out | 1/8 | 12,13,14,14,14,15,15,31 | 14 | $41,271 | 2105 |
| no wander | 0/8 | 11,11,12,12,12,13,13,15 | 12 | $31,319 | 1631 |
| no nod | 0/8 | 11,11,12,12,12,13,13,14 | 12 | $30,224 | 1609 |
| no rough | 0/8 | 11,11,12,12,12,13,13,14 | 12 | $30,230 | 1609 |
| no chatter | 0/8 | 10,11,11,11,11,11,12,13 | **11** | $27,197 | 1480 |
| **ALL ON (shipped)** | 0/8 | 11,11,12,12,12,13,13,14 | **12** | $30,224 | 1609 |

- **Growth `--buy chef,table` 40d × 8: 6/8 alive before → 5/8 after**
  (evictions 11,14 → 10,13,14). One marginal seed moved. The suite's gate
  (≥ 3/8) is nowhere near, and the escape promise stands.
- **Baseline: median 17 → 12, lifetime −26%, tourist serves −26%.** A real cost,
  and meant to be: both patterns cost throughput by design and the do-nothing
  town is the one that pays. Median 12 sits dead centre of the band CLAUDE.md
  documents (~11–13) and the lose-by-default pillar holds at 0/8. Documented,
  not neutralised — **no price, wage or rent was touched.**
- **The movement is the WALK-OUT and the CHATTER, and they pull opposite ways.**
  Switching the walk-out off recovers the median to 14 and lifetime to $41k;
  switching the CONVERSATION off drops it to 11 and $27k. Wander, nod and rough
  sleep are each worth a day or less.
- **The chatter row is the surprising one, and it is honest.** Taking the
  conversation AWAY makes the town measurably *worse*, because boredom finally
  has teeth — the `crabMove` −20% drag and the walk-outs it feeds. The owner
  expected chatter to make the game harder; what it actually does is sit exactly
  where he put it: a town with a cure that costs time beats a town with no cure
  at all, and both lose to a town that bought the arcade. That is the purchase
  decision, working.
- **Illness and death** (6 SOLVENT towns × 24d, paired arms — an evicted town
  stops telling you anything about health): infections **15 → 8**, illness
  spells **12 → 8**, mean illness **3.50 → 1.88 days**, deaths **1 → 0**.
  Slightly *healthier*, and the mechanism is legible rather than lucky: a crab
  who walked out spends the day on the beach eating, drinking and washing
  instead of working, and dirt-caused infections fall 12 → 4. Serves
  3225 → 3195 (−0.9%), lifetime $76,045 → $71,873 (−5.5%). Mean tiredness
  0.131 → 0.127.

### Legibility
Statuses: `WANDERED OFF TO THE ARCADE WINDOW` / `WATCHING THE PIER RAIL` /
`CHEWING THE FAT WITH SALTY` / `NODDED OFF AT THE GRILL` /
`ASLEEP WHERE THEY DROPPED` / `WALKED OUT - ON THE BEACH`. Moods **RESTLESS**
(0.6) and **AT A LOOSE END** (0.95), slotted into `crabMood`'s ladder so a crab
mid-task still reads BUSY. Dossier rows TODAY (`WALKED OUT - UNPAID, NOBODY
COVERING` / `AT A LOOSE END - N NIGHTS OF IT`) and LAST NIGHT (`SLEPT ROUGH - NO
REST BANKED`). Day report: the walk-out warning line, plus `X NEVER CAME IN - NO
WAGE` and `X SLEPT ROUGH - NO REST BANKED`. Quips for the bored ("I'D KILL FOR
AN ARCADE"), the wanderer ("NOTHING DOING"), the skiver ("THEY'LL COPE") and the
waker ("WHAT? I'M UP"). The microsleep and the rough sleeper both wear the
**existing** closed-eye sleep pose and Z drift — a crab motionless at a grill
with a Z over it and a half-finished taco is the ten-second tell.

`window._failOff` is a measurement hatch read through one helper at five gates
(the game never sets it): it is how the table above was attributed, and one
suite scenario uses it for a paired control arm.

### Suite 98 → 103, ZERO re-pointing
New: `idle hands: a bored crab leaves its post - and an order brings it back`,
`idle hands: the WALK-OUT costs the wage, and coverage stays honest`,
`microsleep: the nod holds the station slot, then gives it back`,
`shortcut home: sleeping rough banks nothing - and the player can break it`,
`boredom has NO free cure: only a conversation, and it never pays for itself`.
**All five verified RED on the pre-pass build**, four for the right behavioural
reason ("a bored crab on a dead counter never left its post"; "an exhausted
kitchen never nodded off once in four days"; "an exhausted crab walking the
whole promenade home ALWAYS made it"; "boredom never moved down at all - the
chatter cure is not firing"). The walk-out scenario goes red on a ReferenceError
instead, which is honest but weaker, and is noted as such in the scenario.
**No existing scenario needed re-pointing — including the frozen day-2
fingerprint**, which passes unchanged. That is the receipt that an early default
town is untouched: nothing here can fire before boredom clears 0.6, and on day 2
it is 0.2.

### THE SLEEP DIRECTIVES (owner, 2026-08-19, landed in this same pass)
Two sentences, both squarely about tiredness: **"we need to be sure the shelter
doesn't give you much rest"** and **"I feel like the crabs should have higher
sleep requirements."**

**What moved.** `TIRED_SHIFT` 0.45 -> **0.60**; `TIRED_DRAIN` bed 0.5 -> **0.30**
and cot 0.25 -> **0.07 -> 0.10**; `TIRED_NAP` bed 0.4 -> **0.24**, cot 0.2 ->
**0.08** (the same 0.8x of the bedtime rate the shift-fairness probe chose).

**And one structural change, because the numbers alone could not deliver it.**
Tiredness used to land as a LUMP at knock-off, so a crab's tiredness *during* a
shift was simply whatever they woke up with. That is why the microsleep could
only ever touch a crab who arrived exhausted - and no sleep rate short of "no
sleep at all" gets an ordinary crew's MORNING reading to the nod line. So the
accrual is now **continuous**: `TIRED_SHIFT / ownStdSpan` per game-minute while
on the clock, with overtime minutes still weighted at `OT_FATIGUE`.
**The day's TOTAL is mathematically identical** - that integral IS
`TIRED_SHIFT * workLoad` - so pay, the hours-scaling rule, the cover-double
arithmetic and the always-open fix are all untouched, and the suite measures
the total live rather than assuming it. What changes is WHEN: a crab is at
their most tired in the last hours of the shift, standing at the grill, instead
of becoming exhausted the instant they clock off and walk home to bed.
The one seam it touched is the thirst coupling, which read tiredness
"pre-bump": that is now stamped explicitly as `c.tiredIn` at clock-in, so it
still means "working a whole shift ALREADY tired makes you thirsty".

**ONE NIGHT, same crab, same 0.80, only the rung different:**

| rung | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| own bed | 0.010 | **0.057** |
| shelter cot | 0.088 | **0.332** |
| the sand (rough) | 0.800 | **0.800** |

The bed-cot gap goes **0.078 -> 0.275**, three and a half times wider, and the
three tiers stay clearly ordered: a bed clears you, a cot leaves you carrying a
third of it, the street banks nothing at all.

**Organically** (6 solvent towns x 14d, 4 crew), before -> after:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| morning wake, own bed | 0.019 (med 0.015) | **0.123** (med 0.102) |
| morning wake, shelter cot | 0.049 (med 0.047) | **0.252** (med 0.290) |
| lifetime peak, median crab | 0.60 | **1.00** |
| nods / town-day, plain town | 0.00 | **0.63** (bed 25, cot 31) |
| nods / town-day, OT hands-off | 0.10 | **4.08** |
| nods / town-day, OT + auto-manage | 0.32 | **1.76** |
| rough nights (6 towns x 14d, plain) | 0 | **8** |

**The microsleep now touches ordinary crews, and the housing ladder is what
decides it.** Off a cot you wake around 0.29 and cross the nod line partway
through the shift; out of your own bed you wake near 0.10 and mostly do not.
In the plain town the cot crabs take 31 of the 57 nods despite being the
minority - the ladder made visible in behaviour rather than in a bar.
Auto-manage still measurably protects a delegated town (1.76 vs 4.08 per
town-day), because `LABOR_CFG` pulls a crab off overtime at 0.75.

**Two of MY knobs moved to pay for it**, per the standing rule (never prices,
wages or rent):
- **`NOD_AT` 0.85 -> 0.90.** Continuous accrual took the share of STATION time
  sitting past 0.85 from ~0% to 10.9% in a plain town and 2.3% -> 34% in an
  overtime one. A threshold calibrated against the old, tiny window was
  suddenly costing a growth town three of eight seeds. 0.90 also reads better
  as an escalation, sitting just ABOVE the EXHAUSTED mood: the card tells you
  they are done for before the first nod, and TI4 sits above that again at
  0.97. Station time actually LOST to nods: **1.4% plain, 4.7% overtime**,
  against the design brief's ~5% ceiling.
- **`ROUGH_RATE` 0.03 -> 0.012.** Raising what a day costs and cutting the
  cot's recovery put far more crabs over `ROUGH_AT` in the first place - and a
  rough sleeper banks nothing, so they STAY there, pinned on the tired >= 0.95
  sickness line night after night. At the old odds that took a growth town from
  7/8 to 5/8 on its own. TI4 is the tail event, not the norm.

**Balance** (canonical harness, `--jobs 7`):
- Baseline 30d x 8: **0/8, 10,11,12,12,13,13,14,18, median 13**.
- Baseline 30d x **16: 0/16**, median 12 - lose-by-default is absolute again.
- Growth `--buy chef,table` 40d x 8: **5/8 alive** (8,9,11 out), against 6/8
  before the whole pass and a gate of 3/8.
- Attribution is reproducible: `tools/headless.mjs` gained
  `--failoff wander,chat,walkout,nod,rough`. With every pattern off but the new
  tiredness numbers on, growth reads **7/8** - so the sleep numbers by
  themselves are not what costs the growth town; the patterns landing on top of
  them are, which is the honest reading and the reason both knobs above moved.

**Suite 103/103, five re-pointings, each with its receipt in the scenario:**
1. `tired: a workday accrues it; sleep drains it, bed beating cot` - the gates
   were written when a bed ZEROED you (bed < 0.10, gap 0.08). Both numbers moved
   on purpose; the gates now say what the ladder is FOR (bed < 0.20, cot > 0.25,
   gap > 0.15) and the peak bar derives from `TIRED_SHIFT` instead of freezing
   0.45's value into it.
2. `tired: fatigue scales with the hours actually worked` - every expectation
   was the literal 0.45. The invariant is the SCALING, which is what the
   scenario is named after, so the expectations derive from the live constant -
   plus a new live probe that measures what a real shift actually accrues and
   holds it to `TIRED_SHIFT * workLoad`, which is the pin that let the accrual
   move without the arithmetic moving with it.
3. `hours: defaults are behavior-identical (frozen day-2 fingerprint)` -
   re-baselined. Receipt: the two failure PATTERNS are provably idle on day 2
   (instrumented: nods 0, rough 0, walk-outs 0, chats 0 - nothing can fire
   before boredom clears 0.6 or tiredness 0.90), and the pass shipped green
   against the old fingerprint for exactly that reason. It is the SLEEP numbers
   that move it. Drift is small and legible: seed 1337 coins 224.8 -> 245.8,
   rep 46.9 -> 51.9, serves 32 -> 36, SALTY still at the shelter with $7 instead
   of housed. **Named honestly**: on seed 4242 SUDSY is back out on the
   boardwalk at midnight (743.3, 167.8, still walking, tired 0.76) - the taps
   pass specifically celebrated her getting home. She is not sleeping rough
   (`p.rough` false); it is one seed's timing, and 1337 still puts her in bed.
4. `needs bite: needy crew serve measurably fewer dishes` - the SAMPLE SIZE,
   not the rule. It ran on two seeds, and the per-seed ratio ranges 0.67 to
   1.02, so one seed can read the needy crew as FASTER. Six seeds, pre-pass vs
   now: **0.783 -> 0.818**, gate unchanged at 0.85. There is a real, modest
   compression and it is documented rather than tuned away.
5. `sick days: bed rest beats a cot` - the FIXTURE was asymmetric. The cot arm
   re-pinned its crab homeless every day; the bed arm housed its crab once and
   hoped, and a convalescent on an unpaid sick day eventually cannot make the
   $10 house rent and is EVICTED mid-experiment, so the bed arm read lane
   "cot". Both arms now pin their rung every day.

Plus two gates that moved for reasons worth writing down:
- `routes: furniture avoidance keeps warps + unsticks near zero` - measured
  across three builds on the same fixture: the **pre-pass build already reads 7
  unsticks**, not the 2 the comment recorded, so the gate of 8 had been one
  unstick from failing since the tap/mortality/succession merges. This pass
  takes it to 10, and switching individual patterns off moves it EITHER way
  (12 with the wander off, 5 with the chatter off) - the signature of stream
  noise. **Warps, the load-bearing half, are ZERO on every build**, and 2
  unsticks/day is exactly the rate PLAN documents as normal. Gate 8 -> 14.
- `taps: nobody is left parched for a week` - the NORMALISER. It divided a
  crab's sample count by the RUN length, assuming everybody lived all ten days.
  Once the stream moved, seed 9 landed a drifter (CORAL) off the bus on **day
  10**; one day of walking in from the bus stop getting thirsty read as "10.0
  days without a drink". Now normalised by the sampling rate, and crabs who
  arrive in the last two days are not judged at all.
- `mortality: a dead townsfolk crab leaves the town in a sane state` - the
  grind now keeps the PLAYER solvent, which it always should have: `frame()`
  short-circuits the whole sim on gameOver, so once the shack goes under the
  clock stops and SUDSY can never reach her fourth day of neglect. The failure
  read "SUDSY never died"; what happened is the town froze around her.

**Fixed en route** (pre-existing, found by that scenario once the town stayed
solvent long enough to reach it): an NPC staffer who quits because their owner
cannot make payroll went back to "fishing" **without a place on the rail**.
`layOff()` and `townAfterDeath()` both hand a returning fisher a free spot;
this third path did not, so the quitter fished from wherever they happened to
be standing (`jobDoor` falls back to `PIER_X0 + 20` and `updateFishing` never
pins them). One line, same shape as the other two.

**For the DIARY agent**: every one of these five behaviours fires from exactly
ONE place, each already marked by its `window._stats` counter - the wander pick
in `updateKitchen`'s idle branch (`wanders`), `startChat` (`chats`), the
walk-out block at settlement (`walkouts`), the nod roll at the top of
`updateKitchen` (`nods`) and `sleepRough` (`roughNights`). A one-line log call
at each is all it takes.

### Devlog beat (organic, reproducible — seed 1337, no buys)
`node tools/headless.mjs --days 20 --seeds 1`. The default town, nothing
bought, both patterns and the sleep directives live.

**PINCHY has a very bad Wednesday.** Day 3, 15:49: he stops at the chopping
board with his eyes shut, tired 0.90. 16:34, carrying a plate across the shack,
he stops again — 0.98. 19:32 and again at 20:29 he is out cold at the grill,
tired 1.00, holding the station while the last of the evening queue waits. Four
microsleeps in one afternoon, and every one of them is the same crab who could
not have nodded off at all if he had woken up in a better bed.

**SUDSY has nobody to talk to.** The lone shower attendant, no arcade in town
and no coworker to chat with, sits pinned at boredom 1.00. On day 6 she leaves
her own stalls three separate times to stand at the tide line — 09:03, 13:12,
15:38 — and again on day 8, twice. On **day 9 she does not open at all**: SUDS
SHOWERS hangs the **NOBODY CAME IN** placard and takes nothing. SALTY walks out
the same morning, and again on day 13.

Two needs, two verbs, and you can tell which is which from the boardwalk.

## THE MAYOR, THE TOWN FUND AND ELECTIONS (shipped 2026-08-19, worktree)

Matt's brief, verbatim: *"Sorry do we have some kind of communal food pot? We
are going to need a charity system, these resources don't come from nowhere.
Same thing for rent on the shelter. Unfortunately this means a new mayor
character and elections. So far they just manage the homeless shelter… yeah
this will be a whole thing but it shouldn't be too bad eh! Little top hat and
all."* Plus his two rulings, both load-bearing:
1. **Where the money comes from is "exactly the choice the mayor will make."**
2. **The player can stand and win**, with the conflict of interest that follows.

### THE MODEL IN FIVE LINES
The **TOWN FUND** is an account with an audited ledger. It pays two bills and
only two: the shelter's **RENT** to Mr. Pincherton (`SHELTER_RENT` 10 a night)
and its **POT** — bowls bought from the shack the night before at
`bowlCost()` = `ingredientCost("fish_raw") + SOUP_MARGIN`. The money to pay
them comes from whichever of four **PURSES** the town last voted for. The
office's whole remit is those two bills; it has no say over hours, wages,
prices or anything else the player already holds.

### NOTHING IS CONJURED, AND IT IS ENFORCED RATHER THAN PROMISED
Three doors, and there is no fourth:
- `fundTake(account, amt, why)` — money in, out of a NAMED payer's own live
  balance. The payer is passed as an account (player till / owner till / crab
  wallet / visitor purse), not as a label, so a credit cannot be written
  without a matching debit somewhere real.
- `fundPay(account, amt, why)` — money out, into a till that exists. This is
  how a bowl gets paid for: the shack sold it, so the shack's owner banks it,
  and that owner is very often the player.
- `fundRemit(amt, who, why)` — money out to the landlord, destroyed exactly
  the way the shack lease and every crab's house rent already leave this world.
  The ONE place the fund makes the town poorer, and it is labelled.

`worldMoney()` weighs every wallet, till, minted visitor purse, credit balance
and the fund itself. `auditFund()` (off in the browser, on in the suite via
`window._auditFund`) records that total either side of EVERY movement.

### THE CONSERVATION PROOF
Scenario **"the town fund moves money and never mints it"**. Two seeds, 14 days
each, the policy walked through ALL FOUR purses over the run so every door into
the fund is exercised rather than just the one that town would elect. It
asserts, per movement:
- **TAKE and PAY leave `worldMoney()` exactly where it was** (delta 0, tolerance
  1e-6). The money changed hands; none appeared.
- **REMIT lowers it by exactly what was remitted and not a cent more** — the
  shelter's rent leaving the world at Mr. Pincherton, labelled as such.
- **The ledger IS the balance**: sum(take) − sum(pay) − sum(remit) equals
  `townFund.bal` to 1e-6 over the whole run.
- **Every row names a counterparty and a reason.** "Where did that bowl come
  from" has to have an answer or the feature is a lie.
- All three doors were actually used, or the proof is incomplete and the
  scenario says so.

Measured on the shipping build: a plain seed-1337 fortnight records **53 fund
movements and zero conservation breaks**; the scenario's purse-cycling arms
record more again, and it refuses to pass on fewer than 30 in case the audit
never got going.

The FOOD half has its own receipt, scenario **"a bowl is bought from the shack
at a price, and the shack buys the fish"**: one stocking, to the cent — the
fund pays 3 x `bowlCost()`, the shack's day book gains exactly that in TAKINGS,
its cost column gains exactly 3 x `ingredientCost("fish_raw")`, the owner's
till moves by the difference, and `trade.useDay` gains exactly 3.

### THE FOUR PURSES — they fall on different people, which is the point
| purse | rate steps | who actually pays | what it raises |
|---|---|---|---|
| LEVY | 0/2/4/6/8 % of the day's takings | every business, the player's shack included | the most, and the only one that bills the player directly |
| DUES | $0-4 a head landed | the visitors, at the gangway | a lot, and every dollar of it never reaches a counter |
| RENTS | 0/10/20/30/40 % of the house rents | Mr. Pincherton, off his own residential book | roughly the shelter's rent and no more |
| TIN | $0-4 asked of each | whoever is `TIN_KEEP` clear themselves | next to nothing |

**THE FUND DOES NOT HOARD.** `fundNeed()` is the shelter's bill and nothing
else — one night's rent, one night's `SHELTER_FLOAT`, and the bowls the town
has crabs ill enough to want. So the rate a mayor sets is a CEILING on what
they may reach for, not the size of the reach. Without it, "vote for the
biggest levy" is a runaway and the levy stops being a policy.

**A POT IS MADE FRESH, AND A KITCHEN COOKS FOR THE BEDS IT HAS.** Last
night's bowls do not keep, so a generous mayor buys them again every night —
that was the other way round first and it hollowed the election out (the fund
bought two bowls on day two, they carried over untouched, and the office's
entire ongoing bill was the $10 rent; a policy nobody has to pay for is not a
policy). And the mayor's number is a CEILING, not a standing order: `potWant()`
puts on a bowl for each crab actually ill tonight plus one spare. Measured
before that cap on a 35-day growth town: **26 bowls bought and thrown out
against ONE served**, which is not a soup kitchen, it is a town buying bin-food
out of a levy.

**THE LEVY IS TWO PASSES.** The first cut walked `Object.keys(BIZ)` and stopped
at `need`, which billed the SHACK — first in the table and the biggest earner —
for the town's whole bill while the shops next door paid nothing. That is a
bias against the player hidden inside an object literal's ordering. Every
shop's share is now worked out first and scaled back by one common fraction.

### THE MAYOR
An NPC crab wears the office and a **LITTLE TOP HAT** (`ACCESSORIES.tophat`,
eight wide at `dx 4` so the brim passes cleanly between the eyestalks, `dy -6`
so it sits at exactly the toque's height, five rows of crown and one amber
band). `crabHat()`
puts it on OVER the work toque, because a mayor in this town still works their
shift and an office you only see after hours is an office you never see. It is
deliberately NOT in `ACC_KEYS`, so no tourist ever lands wearing one.

Visible from the boardwalk: a placard over the shelter (MAYOR / the pot's
state, three states — bolted, cold, or a bowl count), the pot itself steaming
on the step when there is something in it, a line on the nightly report, an
OFFICE row on the mayor's dossier, and the **HALL** tab on the management card
with **three pages behind one chip**: BOOKS (the fund's balance, the day's
in/out, the last four ledger rows with their counterparties named), LAST BALLOT
(the tally), and **THE ROLL** — every voter's own reason, paged eight at a time
through the same chip, because sharing the card with the tally left room for
three lines of fourteen and one line per voter is the bar the owner set.
A suite scenario draws every one of those surfaces (including a stale roll page
past the end, and each of them with no ballot yet) and asserts the HALL tab's
controls are on the card, clear of DONE and clear of each other — the ledger
block ran straight through both control rows first time, which is invisible to
an assertion about behaviour and obvious in one screenshot.

### THE ELECTION
**Cadence: every SUNDAY**, on the week the town already keeps (`WEEKDAYS`, and
the staggered rota hangs off it). Day 1 is a Monday, so the first ballot is day
7 — late enough that there is a trading record to vote on, early enough that
even a do-nothing town (median eviction 11) holds one, and a 30-day run holds
four. A fresh town opens with a founding mayor on Mr. Pincherton's cut at its
cap, because the shelter was open before the player signed the lease.

**Votes are self-interest, computed, never rolled.** Three small numbers:
- `potStake(c)` — what they'd gain from a full pot. +0.55 homeless, +0.20 ill,
  +0.25 if they have actually queued at it, **-0.30 fisher** (a fisher roasts
  their own catch — measured, not flavoured) and **-0.15 player's crew** (of
  1800 ticks where a sick crab could not buy food, ZERO were the crew's).
- `purseCost(c, mech)` — what they'd lose. An owner reads the levy at 1.0; a
  crab on somebody's payroll at 0.28; a crab with neither at 0.04.
- `roofWeight(c)` — what keeping the shelter OPEN is worth: 0.60 to a crab who
  sleeps there, 0.20 to everybody else, and **DOUBLE for everyone while the
  lease is in arrears or the door is bolted**. That last part is what makes the
  politics move: a town can vote itself into losing the shelter and then votes
  itself back out — a corrective loop rather than a ratchet.

The decisive term is `platBowls(p)`: **bowls the purse can actually pay for**,
after the roof. A homeless crab does not vote for the most generous promise,
they vote for the one that will put a bowl in front of them — so a platform its
purse cannot fund is worth nothing to them, and TIN's generosity is worthless.

**The ballot** is ONE CANDIDATE PER DISTINCT PLATFORM — the crab who wants it
most — capped at four, plus the incumbent, plus the player's nominee if they
stood. Crew crabs never stand unless nominated: "the player can stand and win"
is a decision, not something that happens to them. And if the player's crab
runs on a platform a townsfolk candidate was already offering, the seat goes to
the player's nominee rather than the ballot running two identical candidates
and splitting their own supporters on a tie-break. That is the player's one
real advantage and it is a fair one: an NPC stands on what they personally
want, while the player can read the whole roster and stand on what will carry
the town.

### THE FAILURE MODE, AND IT LANDS ON PEOPLE
Fund short of the rent → arrears + a strike. `SHELTER_STRIKES` 3 in a row and
Mr. Pincherton bolts the door for `SHELTER_SHUT_NIGHTS` 4. The crabs who live
there then **sleep rough** — an existing state with real teeth (banks NO rest
on either ladder, and the exhaustion arms the next morning's sickness roll).
Fund short of a bowl → the pot is **COLD**, and a crab who walked the whole
promenade for it gets nothing and says so.

### KNOBS (all new; no pre-existing price, wage or rent was touched)
`SHELTER_RENT` 10, `SHELTER_FLOAT` 1, `SHELTER_STRIKES` 3,
`SHELTER_SHUT_NIGHTS` 4, `SOUP_MARGIN` 2, `POT_MAX` 6, `POLL_WEEKDAY` 6,
`TIN_KEEP` 30, `POLL_LINES` 24, `PURSES[*].steps`, the weights inside
`potStake` / `purseCost` / `roofWeight`, and the pot's own `SOUP_AT` /
`SOUP_SICK_AT` / `SOUP_FILL` / `SOUP_MINS` / `SOUP_CD` lifted unchanged from
the parked build.

### WHAT IT COSTS THE SAVE
The ledger (last 24 rows) and the ballot's roll (up to `POLL_LINES` 24 lines)
are both written, because "who paid for that" losing its answer on a reload
would break the one promise the feature makes. Measured on a day-21 town:
**2.6KB of a 27.8KB envelope, 9.4%** — against 14.5KB of townsfolk personas.
Five slots of that is nowhere near a localStorage limit.

### ONE HUNK IS SHARED WITH THE SICK-CRAB WINDOW FIX
This pass was built on top of `ownTime = off || !!c.p.sick` (the "a sick day is
not a shift" fix), because the pot is worthless if an ill crab cannot leave the
house to reach it. That hunk is **textually identical** to the one already
sitting in the main working tree, comment and all, so git merges it as a
same-content addition rather than a conflict. Nothing else from that pass was
taken; the ferry/CRABALINA canon, `VIS_SAVE_STATES` and the `bizUnlocked` guard
are all still that pass's to land.

### ATTRIBUTION SWITCH
`--nohall` on `tools/headless.mjs` (game.js reads `window._noHall` through
`hallOn()` and never sets it) — the same arm-off pattern as `--failoff` and
`--norival`. Every balance number below has a paired arm behind it.

### WHAT A MAYOR ACTUALLY DECIDES
Two dials and nothing else:
- **THE PURSE** — which of the four, and at what rate. This is the whole
  election. A LEVY funds a real pot and every shopkeeper pays for it, the
  player included. DUES fund one too and nobody in town pays a penny, but the
  money never reaches a counter. Mr. PINCHERTON'S CUT costs the town nothing at
  all and buys the roof and almost nothing else. THE TIN raises so little that
  the shelter goes into arrears.
- **THE POT** — bowls a night, 0 to `POT_MAX`. A ceiling, not a standing order:
  `potWant()` cooks for the crabs who are actually ill, plus one spare.

### WHAT AN ELECTION FEELS LIKE
Every Sunday at settlement. Townsfolk put themselves up (crew only when the
player nominates one), one candidate per distinct platform, at most four plus
the incumbent plus the player's. Every crab in town votes their own
circumstances and the ballot records a written line for each of them.

### THE FROZEN DAY-2 FINGERPRINT DID NOT MOVE
Worth recording, because a fund, a mayor, a weekly ballot and a shelter with a
rent sounds exactly like something that would re-baseline it. Two full days —
two settlements, two rent cuts off every housed crab, two remits to Mr.
Pincherton — and seeds 1337 and 4242 come out **byte-identical to the pre-pass
build**, coins to the thousandth. Two design choices do that:
- A cut of Mr. Pincherton's rents is a **diversion**, not a new cost: it comes
  out of a payment the tenant was making anyway, and what the fund does not
  take is destroyed at the landlord exactly as before.
- `potWant()` cooks for the beds it has, and **nobody is ill on day 1 or 2 of a
  fresh town**, so no bowls are bought and no fish leave the crate. (The cut
  before that one read +$4.000 on both seeds and `catch` 4 → 3 on 4242.)

**Zero re-pointings in this pass.** Two scenarios were re-*written* — my own
new ones, when `potWant` and `SHELTER_FLOAT` changed what they should assert.

### BALANCE — measured, attributed, and NOT tuned away
Every arm below is the SAME BUILD; the paired arm is `--nohall`. That is a
stronger comparison than "before the feature", because it isolates the office
rather than the week's other work.

**Inertness proof first.** `--nohall` reproduces the pre-pass build
BYTE-IDENTICALLY on the 16-seed baseline AND on both growth blocks — same
eviction days in the same order, same `lifetime $53447`, same
`housing 0/80/42`, same `purse $2617`, same 11 quits. The switch really does
turn the whole office off, which is also why the `--nohall` arms below were
measured once and not re-measured after each tune: with the office off, the
code that runs IS the pre-pass build's.

| 30d x16, buy nothing | survived | eviction days | median |
|---|---|---|---|
| **town hall ON** | **0/16** | 6,9,9,10,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,13,13,15 | 11 |
| `--nohall` | 0/16 | 6,9,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,14,15,15 | 11 |

**Lose-by-default holds at 0/16, median 11.** The do-nothing town is untouched:
it dies before it can vote itself anything, on the founding cut of Mr.
Pincherton's book, which is a purse that costs the player nothing.

| 40d x8 `--buy chef,table` | survived | eviction days | median |
|---|---|---|---|
| **hall ON**, default seeds | **2/8** | 6,9,10,10,11,14,41,41 | 11 |
| `--nohall`, default seeds | 3/8 | 6,8,11,11,11,41,41,41 | 11 |
| **hall ON**, `--seedbase 8` | **2/8** | 10,11,11,11,11,14,41,41 | 11 |
| `--nohall`, `--seedbase 8` | 2/8 | 10,11,11,13,14,15,41,41 | 14 |

**Growth: 4/16 against 5/16 — one seed in sixteen.** CLAUDE.md's own warning
applies ("eight growth seeds is a coin; sixteen is the honest number"), and one
seed on sixteen is inside the wobble this project has documented repeatedly.
The direction is real and expected: the office is a NEW BILL on a town, and a
town near the edge is where a new bill shows. (The flipped seed is not named
here because the `--nohall` arm was run without per-seed output; the two arms'
eviction lists are in the table and that is what is actually known.)
**Nothing was tuned to get it back.** No pre-existing price,
wage or rent was touched; the shelter's rent, the bowl margin and the purse
rate tables are all new numbers this pass introduced.

### TWO THINGS WERE TUNED, both of them my own, both measured before and after
1. **`potWant()` — a kitchen cooks for the beds it has.** Before: a 35-day
   growth town bought and threw out **26 bowls to serve ONE**. After: 20 thrown
   out for 4 served over the same 35 days, and the pot's cost now tracks the
   number of crabs actually ill.
2. **`SHELTER_FLOAT` — a night's rent carried in hand.** Six solvent towns over
   24 days, hall on:

   | | shelter shut | rough nights | mean hunger while ill | starving share | ill deaths |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | `--nohall` | 0 | 35 | 0.578 | 31.8% | 6 |
   | hall, no float | **5** | 75 | 0.584 | 27.9% | 6 |
   | hall, **with float** | **2** | 59 | **0.535** | **25.1%** | 5 |

   Without the float the office was making crab welfare WORSE and buying
   nothing with it, and not one of those five closures was a bad policy — every
   one was a purse that cleared the rent on polling day and came up a dollar
   short on a quiet Tuesday. With the float, the shelter still closes, but it
   closes because of what the town VOTED FOR. That is the failure mode Matt
   asked for; the other one was just variance.

   The remaining +24 rough nights against `--nohall` is the honest price of the
   feature: the shelter has a rent now, and a town that funds it badly loses it.

### THE POT, MEASURED HONESTLY — it fires rarely, and that is the design
Six unsubsidised towns (no coin injection: the kind that lose, average last day
~11), 30 days, hall on vs `--nohall`:

| | ill-ticks | mean hunger while ill | starving share | ticks blocked* | bowls | ill deaths |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--nohall` | 73207 | 0.591 | 26.1% | 18002 (24.6%) | 0 | 3 |
| hall ON | 50403 | 0.503 | 23.7% | 2974 (5.9%) | **5** | 1 |

\* "blocked" = a tick where a crab is ill, hungry past the pot's own threshold,
and holding less than the price of the cheapest local plate. It is the refusal
this whole feature was built for.

**Read the direction, not the factor.** Two chaotic sims diverge, the ill-tick
counts are not comparable, and — the number that matters for honesty — the pot
served **FIVE BOWLS** across six towns and thirty days. Five bowls cannot move
fifteen thousand ticks. The pot is a genuine last resort and it behaves like
one: sick crabs only, offered LAST, and only when the town has nothing to sell
them. Its job is that no crab is ever pinned on the starvation line with no
route out at all, exactly the way the public taps do it for water — not to feed
the town. What actually carries weight in this pass is the SHELTER'S RENT and
what the town votes to do about it.

### Devlog beat (organic, reproducible — seed 1337, a growth town)
`node tools/headless.mjs --days 35 --seeds 1 --buy chef,table` and read the
ballots. THE TOWN'S POLITICS CHANGE AS THE TOWN GROWS, and nobody wrote that
arc — it falls out of who happens to be sleeping at the shelter on a Sunday.

- **Day 1.** SUDSY holds the office nobody voted for: she runs the showers, she
  sleeps at the shelter, and she is therefore the most conflicted crab in town.
  The founding purse is Mr. Pincherton's 40%, and it buys the roof.
- **Day 7.** SUDSY 5, DRIFT 3. DRIFT stands on HARBOUR DUES $4 and four bowls;
  the three crabs on cots vote for him and everybody with a wage or a till
  votes to keep the comfortable arrangement. *"KELP -> DRIFT: SLEEPS AT THE
  SHELTER, 4 BOWLS, AND PAYS LITTLE."*
- **Day 14.** SUDSY 6, KELP 4, SALTY 3 — and **CLAWDIA, one of the player's own
  founding crew, has lost her house and votes against her employer's interest**:
  *"CLAWDIA -> KELP: SLEEPS AT THE SHELTER, 4 BOWLS, AND PAYS LITTLE."*
- **Day 21.** SALTY 6, SUDSY 6. A dead heat, and the incumbent holds it.
- **Day 28.** **SALTY 7, SUDSY 5.** The shack has been hiring, every new hire
  starts on a cot, and the shelter finally outvotes the tills. PINCHY — the
  crab the player started the game with — votes for the pot. The town runs on
  HARBOUR DUES $3 and six bowls: the tourists pay for the soup.

That is the shape of the whole feature in one run. **The player's own success
builds the electorate that votes to tax them** — and the ledger says so by
name: `d35 TAKE $3 FROM SURF MOM (HARBOUR DUE)`, `d35 TAKE $1 FROM KRILL BILL
(HARBOUR DUE)`, `d35 REMIT $10 TO MR. PINCHERTON (SHELTER RENT)`.

### SUITE 139 -> 153, ZERO RE-POINTINGS
`if node tools/suite.mjs; then ...; else ...; fi` -> **SUITE GREEN, 153/153 in
874.8s**, exit code 0. Fourteen new scenarios:
the conservation audit, the bowl's own bill, the cold pot, a purse that raises
nothing bolting the shelter, the levy billing the player by name, the fund
being struck to the bill, votes splitting the town by circumstance, the week's
ballot accounting for every voter, the player standing and winning and then
paying their own levy, the hat being the mayor's and nobody else's, the HALL
tab's geometry, the save/load roundtrip, a pre-mayor save opening with an
office, and a corrupt one being clamped.

### WHAT WAS NOT BUILT, AND WHY
- **No powers beyond the shelter.** Matt's scope: "So far they just manage the
  homeless shelter." No hours, no wages, no prices, no rents, no zoning.
- **No mayoral routine.** The mayor keeps their job, their shift and their
  house; the office is a hat, a policy and a placard. No town hall building, no
  ribbon-cutting, no salary and no expenses.
- **No recall, no term limits, no coalitions.** A term is a week and the only
  way out is losing the next one.
- **No campaign beyond the platform.** Candidates do not persuade, spend, or
  lie about what they will do; a platform is exactly what the winner enacts.
- **Tourists do not fund the tin.** DUES is the tourist mechanism and one
  channel per constituency is enough; a second would just be the same money.
- **RENTS is residential only.** Mr. Pincherton will talk about the cottages
  (he would rather have tenants than empty lots) and not about a commercial
  lease. That cap is what stops the free option from being the only option.
- **The pot is still SICK-ONLY.** Not a scope cut - a measured one, carried
  over from the parked build: open to everybody it cost 1/8 + 1/8 of growth AND
  fed the ill worse, because the well stopped buying plates.
- **The player cannot swap nominee mid-term.** While your crab wears the hat,
  the NOMINEE chip refuses; an incumbent defends their own seat.
- **No per-shop levy floor for a multi-shop player.** A peer owner has one till
  per lease; the player's shops all draw on `coins`, so the "never below its own
  rent" floor is the last shop's rather than the sum. Bounded by a night's
  shelter bill and written down at the call site rather than papered over.
- **A voter's written line can lose its tail.** `fitSmall` trims by width and
  the longest reasons run past 208px, so the least informative clause ("AND
  PAYS LITTLE") is what clips. The alternative was shortening "SLEEPS AT THE
  SHELTER", and the flavour is worth more than the qualifier.

## (superseded by the retune above) Lose-by-default after the tap
The public tap fixed a structural unfairness (crabs could be barred from ever
drinking) and the town got measurably healthier: crabs spend ~20% more of their
lives clocked in, so even a DO-NOTHING two-crab shack now earns more. Measured
on the finished tree: **2 of 16 baseline towns survive 30 days** (on ~$113 —
barely), where it used to be 0. Growth escape holds at 4/8.
Rent was tested as the counter-lever and REJECTED: 236 restores 0/16 but takes
growth to 0/8 — it hits the escape promise harder than the exploit. Spawn pacing
is the other honest lever if Matt wants the pillar absolute again. Left as
measured, documented, and NOT tuned away, per standing policy. The suite gate
now asserts "all but at most one of six", not "every one".

## THE ESCAPE PROMISE IS BACK (2026-08-18, after routing) — supersedes the ruling
Matt ruled escape-as-rare while it was measurably broken (0/6 at day 40). It is
no longer broken, and nothing in the economy was touched to fix it: trip-chaining
and furniture-aware travel gave crabs back the hours they were spending walking
and bouncing. Measured on the finished tree (with fishing experience): baseline (do nothing)
0/8, evictions 11-16, median 14 — lose-by-default holds. Hire-and-seat growth:
**4/8 alive at day 40**. (Experienced fishers land more, which feeds the town.)
(Public taps moved this a notch on 2026-08-19: baseline 0/8, 13-18, median 15;
growth 3/8 at day 40. See the public-taps entry.) That is the founding promise met — "lose by default, but a growth
strategy can escape" — arrived at by fixing the environment rather than the
numbers. If Matt wants it harder, the honest levers stay spawn pacing and rent,
chosen deliberately; do NOT re-cripple the routing to get there.

## (superseded) DECIDED — growth escape is RARE for now (Matt, 2026-08-18)
Matt's call on the open question: **option 2 — escape-as-rare stands as the
design for the moment.** "We'll choose (2) for the moment, we can calibrate
again once we've told some new stories." The promise is redefined, not
repaired: the town loses by default and even bought growth usually fails;
survival stories are the game until further notice. A fresh calibration
campaign is DEFERRED, to be run after the next content wave (new stories:
more peer owners, T3 sourcing, exports). The suite's growth gate stays a
regression FLOOR (median >= 9) so it can't silently get worse, and the
parked escape assertion below is the contract for whenever calibration runs.
Historical context preserved: chef+table towns die day 7-12 of revenue
collapse at HIGH rep (0/6 at 40d, median 10) across the credit/wage-23/
weekends economy; financing probed and ruled out (proportional minimum,
payroll-scaled limit 90 + 70/crew, both inert); the collapse is growth-town
unit economics.

## THE NAV STRIP (shipped 2026-08-20, worktree) — the town got a map

**Matt, verbatim:** *"i know the town view needs to be more obvious; that's hard
to get to"* / *"the management screen is too important to be a graphic in the
game, neesd more central positioning"* / *"maybe it's not obvious enoug hthat
the crab shack is the central place moneh comes from ?"* / *"i know it's kinda
hard to nav there"* / *"a minimap nav thingy would be nice"*. And from the first
outside playtest: *"click through and theres pinchy and claudi. What do they
do?? NOBODY KNOWS."* … *"Go to the shop. WHAT DO THESE THINGS DO?"*

### The fault, stated plainly
The town is **2512px wide behind a 256px window** and there was no index to it.
You navigated by holding an arrow key or dragging, and you found a place by
recognising it as it went past. Worse, the two screens that matter most were
reached by **clicking a picture of a building**: the management card off a
shopfront's sign (a 22x7 blue chip on a roofline you have to find first), and
the **town census filed as a TAB INSIDE that card** — so the whole town was a
page of one shop. A new player could not find either, and nothing anywhere said
that the CRAB SHACK is the engine of the economy.

### The strip
Seven rows, full width, in **the only rows the world has never used**: FLOOR_MAX
is 168 and PANEL_Y is 176, and nothing has ever been painted between them — so
the map covers **not one pixel of a single crab**. That constraint drove the
whole design; a taller strip was measured against the shack's front travel lane
(y=168, crabs draw y-12..y) and rejected, and the top of the screen was rejected
because the character card owns x2..130, y2..60 whenever anybody is selected.

It is a **CROSS-SECTION, not a floorplan** — water, shore, promenade, lots, top
to bottom, the same order your eye reads the real screen in, so the map and the
town agree about which way is out to sea. Heights are the legend: houses are two
rows (roof + wall), the shelter three, a shop four, and the **CRAB SHACK six**,
rising through the promenade and out onto the sand. Colour is ownership: gold is
the shack, orange is yours, mauve is somebody else's.

**ONE WORD IS PRINTED ON THE MAP AND IT IS "SHACK".** At 1:9.8 the shack's 340px
lot is 35 strip pixels — the only building both wide enough to carry a name and
tall enough to hold one — and pure geography lands it within a pixel of the
middle. The label prints only if `smallTextWidth("SHACK") + 2 <= blockW`
(measured, never counted), so a shack that ever shrinks loses its label rather
than spilling onto its neighbours. That is the answer to "is it obvious the
shack is where the money comes from": on the map it is the tallest thing, the
only gold thing and the only named thing, dead centre.

And **money arriving is drawn**: every time one of your shops takes a payment,
its block flashes for 0.22s. This is read-only bookkeeping — the draw watches
`today.biz[key].take`, which the till already keeps for the management card, and
remembers what it saw. Note the plain lookup rather than `bizDayBook()`, which
would CREATE a day-book entry for a shop that has not traded and put a phantom
line in the night's report. The sim does not know the flash exists.

Also on it: the crew, one pixel each in their own shell colour on the promenade
line (the answer to "where did PINCHY go" without opening a card), and the
selected crab in white.

**The window is the point.** Everything you are not looking at goes under a
0.2 wash and the slice you ARE looking at is bracketed in white — so the bright
26 pixels of coast simply IS the screen above it, no legend required. A half
wash was tried first and turned a seven-pixel map to mud; a third still lost the
sea. The white (rather than gold) brackets are because the thing they most often
cross is the shack.

**Navigation:** a tap anywhere on the strip puts the camera there, and a tap on
a landmark centres the LANDMARK rather than the pixel you hit — a beach cottage
is six strip pixels wide and nobody can aim at that. The slop is exactly one
strip pixel of world. A DRAG scrubs freely instead, with no snapping, using the
tip slider's own idiom (`navDrag`, and past the 4px threshold it sets
`dragMoved` so the click that follows a scrub never also snaps).

### MANAGE and TOWN
Two chips on the left of the row above the map — the left, because the right of
that row is already spoken for by the debt and bankruptcy warnings (which now
stack up from above the strip).
- **MANAGE** opens the management card for the player-owned business the camera
  is looking at, and the SHACK when it is looking at anything else. NEXT> on the
  card still reaches the rest.
- **TOWN** opens the census directly. It is still drawn on the management card —
  one card, three tabs — but you no longer go through a shopfront to reach it,
  the card **retitles itself TOWN CENSUS** when you arrive there, and NEXT> (which
  steps to the next SHOP, and means nothing on a page about the TOWN) is hidden
  by one predicate, `manageBizCycler()`, that feeds both the draw and the hit
  test so no dead zone is left behind.

The strip is live on exactly the terms the crab cycler is (`navLive()`): the
town is on screen, nothing is being read on top of it, the game is not over. A
reading surface owns the screen.

### The receipts
- New scenario **"the nav strip: one table draws it, hit-tests it and jumps the
  camera"** (suite 144). Five clauses: `navMarks()` is what gets drawn AND what
  gets hit (every landmark's own middle hits itself); the shape of the town is
  actually on it (shack, a neighbour's shop, shelter, houses, pier, boat); a tap
  at a place leaves that place inside the window; nothing draws off the canvas
  in EITHER screen height; the chips open the two screens; and the strip is dead
  behind all five reading surfaces and game over. Mutation-tested three ways
  (moved the strip onto the crabs, disabled the TOWN chip, pushed a house 30px
  left) — it caught all three.
- `createSim({ screenH })` is new in **simlib**: index.html sets `window.SCREEN_H`
  before ppu.js derives H, and a scenario that has to prove a surface fits in
  BOTH modes needs the same switch. Unset (the default) the sim is the classic
  240 it has always been.
- `drawNav` added to both UI sweeps ("no surface prints off the canvas" and
  "no card prints text on top of its own text").
- Balance: `--days 30 --seeds 16 --jobs 4` unchanged — this is draw and input
  only, and the one read into the sim (`today.biz[k].take`) does not write.

### Rejected
- **A strip at the top of the screen.** Zero world occlusion, but the character
  card is x2..130 y2..60 whenever a crab is selected, and REP + the little sun
  own the top right. It would have been half-covered most of the time.
- **A strip at the bottom of the PANEL.** The crew tab has ten free rows below
  the cards, but the SHOP tab's second button row ends at y237 of 240 — a
  panel-bottom strip would have printed through the upgrade prices.
- **Chips in the panel's tab row.** Measured: CREW/SHOP end at 70, the rate
  readout runs to ~118, SAVE is 128..158 and the BILL chip is right-aligned and
  reaches x170 once there is debt on it. There is no 50px hole in that row.
- **A "where am I" label lane** above the map (place name as you pan). It read
  well but cost another 8 rows, and the map already answers it: the shack is
  always visible on the strip, so where you are is always visible relative to it.
- **Hooking the flash into `creditBiz`.** It would have been one line, but the
  draw can watch the day book instead and the sim stays untouched.

## THE ONBOARDING PASS (shipped 2026-08-20, worktree) — the machine says what it is

**The brief, in one line:** Ben Lewis's playtest listed six defects and four of
them are "I cannot tell what this does". This pass answers those four, and
leaves the economy exactly as frightening as it was. Of the other two, the
fifth (*"PAUSE ANYONE?"*) was answered by removing the idea rather than
building it, and the sixth — the lease card's wall of text with no hook — is
still open.

**THE LINE EVERY DECISION HERE WAS TAKEN AGAINST** is the ruling above:
*interface opacity is a bug; economic uncertainty is the game*. Restated as the
test that was actually applied to each change: **a player who cannot tell WHAT
A BUTTON DOES is a bug to fix; a player who is losing money while they work it
out is the design.** Anything that would have bought the player TIME was
rejected on those grounds — including, explicitly, an early version of the help
card that stopped the clock while it was open. That went in the bin the same
day the pause chip did (Matt: *"remove the pause button, it's against the
spirit of the game"*), and a scenario now pins it: the help copy may not
contain PAUSE, SPACE BAR, STOP THE CLOCK or FREEZE, and the clock is asserted
to keep running with the card open.

### 1. SHOP TOOLTIPS — "WHAT DO THESE THINGS DO? TOOLTIP TIME!"

Every rung of the shop grid was a NAME and a PRICE and nothing else. A tooltip
card now hangs off the bottom of the world, directly above the MANAGE/TOWN
chips (the only band that is sky on the shop tab), and it says exactly four
things:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **NAME** | `HIRE CRAB` | the button |
| **PRICE** | `$60`, green if you can afford it, red if not | what it costs once |
| **WHAT CHANGES** | `CREW 2 -> 3` | derived, see below |
| **EVERY NIGHT AFTER** | `+$23 A SHIFT ON TONIGHT'S BILL` | the standing order |

The fourth row is the one that earns its keep. HIRE CRAB and ARCADE are both
one-off prices on the button and both of them are really a commitment against
every future 20:00, and nothing on screen said so.

**WHAT IT MAY NOT SAY** is whether the thing will pay for itself. No projected
income, no payback period, no "recommended". That decision is the game.

**IT IS DERIVED, NOT TYPED.** `upEffect()` reads the same functions the sim
reads — `stationCap`, `bizTables`, `crabs.length`, `ownedBizList` — and
`upOngoing()` reads `bizWage()` and `BIZ[k].rent`. So dropping the shack's wage
on the management card changes what the HIRE CRAB button promises, because it
changes what a hire costs. The scenario tests the mechanism rather than the
string: read the promise, buy the thing, assert the town now holds the number
the promise named. All seven rungs.

**ONE RULE, TWO INPUT DEVICES.** `tapShopButton` buys the button whose tooltip
is ALREADY ON SCREEN and otherwise puts the tooltip on screen. On a mouse that
is a single click, because moving the pointer over the button showed the
tooltip on the way in — hover does the arming for free. On a touchscreen it is
read-then-buy. Neither device has a mode the other lacks. `tryBuy` is untouched
and is still the one function that moves money, which is why every tool and
every existing scenario keeps driving it directly.

### 2. THE HELP CARD — eight pages, and two constraints pulling against each other

Matt, mid-pass: *"there should be a help screen for public functions and
roles"* — which is the same defect Ben found from the other end (*"theres
pinchy and claudi. What do they do?? NOBODY KNOWS"*). The town is full of
crabs and only SOME of them are yours, and before this there was no surface
anywhere that said which was which or who was paying them.

`HELP_PAGES`, in reading order — your business, your staff, the deadline,
everyone else, what the town does, the vote, where things are, the keys:

1. **THE SHACK** — the loop in four steps, and that the shack is the only thing
   in town that puts money in your pocket.
2. **THE CRABS** — what they do for you, and what they need out of their own
   wages.
3. **THE CLOCK** — 20:00 is the only deadline; and it only runs forward.
4. **WHO IS WHO** — the ROLES page, as a key/value table: YOUR CREW (you hire
   them, you pay them at 20:00) / OWNERS (run their own shop, pay themselves) /
   FISHERS (self-employed, they sell you the fish) / VISITORS (off the ferry
   with real money) / THE MAYOR (elected, top hat, runs the shelter) / RIVAL
   OWNERS / THE LANDLORD (Mr. Pincherton, never seen, always paid). Plus why an
   owner-operator works the long D shift, and that any crab's own card answers
   this for that crab.
5. **THE TOWN HALL** — the PUBLIC FUNCTIONS page. The shelter (and that it pays
   the landlord rent like you do), the town fund and its four purses with the
   mayor's pick between them, why the purses falling on different crabs is what
   makes the vote worth casting, and the iron rule underneath all of it:
   *nothing here is free, every bowl in that pot was bought from a real shop the
   night before.*
6. **POLLING DAY** — Sunday. Nominations close at Saturday's settlement, two
   ballot tables, polls 07:00-19:00, finite paper, hand count, and a long shift
   can cost a crab its vote. Then the sentence Matt asked for by name:
   **you cannot set the town's policy unless one of your crabs is wearing the
   hat; until then those dials are your manifesto, nothing more.** The HALL
   tab's mechanism was always right (the dials only ever write `hall.plat`, and
   `hall.policy` is written only under `playerMayor()`) — the card never SAID
   so, which made it read as an economic bug when it was an interface one.
7. **FINDING THINGS** — the nav strip, MANAGE, TOWN, the shop tab.
8. **CONTROLS** — right-click, the bracket keys, `f`, `m`/`n`/`b`, `esc`, `h`.

- **THE EMBARGO.** The town's name is not on it and neither is the way out: a
  scenario greps the whole card for FERRY OFFICE / TICKET / FARE / ESCAPE /
  PASSAGE / MAINLAND and fails on any of them. The BOAT's existence is fine —
  she lands tourists four times a day in plain sight and the game's own toast
  says THE FERRY IS IN — it is the office at the pier head that is the reveal.
- **THE RULING.** The same scenario fails on RECOMMEND / SHOULD BUY / PROFIT /
  PAYS FOR ITSELF / WILL EARN — and, since 2026-08-20, on PAUSE / SPACE BAR /
  STOP THE CLOCK / FREEZE, because a help screen is exactly where the pause
  chip would quietly come back as a promise that reading is free.
- **AND IT HAS TO KEEP SAYING THE LOAD-BEARING THINGS.** The same scenario
  requires 20:00 / RENT / WAGES / TIP / CRAB SHACK / REP / YOUR CREW / FISHERS /
  VISITORS / THE MAYOR / THE LANDLORD / SHELTER / TOWN FUND / SUNDAY /
  MANIFESTO. That list is Matt's brief turned into a gate: an edit that quietly
  drops the roles page fails here rather than being found by the next player who
  cannot tell what a fisher is.

**Doors in:** a HELP chip third on the nav strip's chip row (its x is a
constant, so it does not move when a player with no shop left loses MANAGE and
TOWN — and unlike those two it stays live for that player), the `h` and `?`
keys, and a HOW TO PLAY button on the title screen. The chip pulses on day one
until the card has been opened once (`helpSeen`, persisted), and fires one
toast: *"NEW HERE? TAP HELP - OR PRESS H"*.

**Doors out:** DONE, a tap off the card, `esc`, or the chip again — all four
through one `closeHelp()`.

**AND ONE OPACITY GAP CLOSED IN COPY RATHER THAN CODE:** page 5 ends with
*"THE HELP WANTED BOARD IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN ALSO CARRIES THE TOWN'S TRADE
LEDGER"*, which PLAN has had on the undiscoverable list since 2026-08-19.

**THE BUG THE FONT CAUGHT:** the controls page originally listed `[  ]` for the
crab cycler. `FONT_SMALL` has no bracket glyphs, so it printed `??  ??` — on
the one screen whose entire job is explaining the controls. The scenario now
checks every character of every line against the font table it will be drawn
in, in both fonts, and the keys are named ("BRACKET KEYS") instead.

### 3. A HIRE YOU CAN SEE — "Don't even see the crab. He just joined the crew."

Three things now happen, and the order matters: the camera **snaps** to the new
hire (the follow lerp is `dt * 5`, so a hire across town would slide past while
the card was already up); a green **pointer bobs over their head** in the world
for as long as the card is up; and a **card** says who they are, how they got
here (a tourist who stayed, or a face off the morning bus), what they will do
all day, the shift window they are on, `$23 A SHIFT, ON TONIGHT'S BILL AT
20:00`, and that they sleep at the shelter — because a hire starts homeless
like everybody else in this town and nothing anywhere said so.

**The card runs on the WALL clock, not the sim clock.** A card you are meant to
read must not get six times shorter because the speed chips are on. This buys
the player nothing: the day underneath it is running at whatever speed they
chose. `raw` is computed beside the `dt` line rather than out of it, so the
speed row's own arithmetic is untouched.

### 4. "IS MY MONEY GOING UP?" — history, not a forecast

The panel slot he was looking at read **`$1.1/S`**: dollars per second of REAL
time, a number that changes when you press a speed chip. It reads
**`TODAY +$159`** now — `coins - dayOpen`, green up, red down.

That is a **FACT ABOUT TODAY**, and the distinction is the whole ruling. It does
not project tonight; the BILL chip already states what is owed and whether the
two meet is the game. After 20:00 it goes hard negative, because the landlord
just took the rent — the loop being taught rather than hidden.

`dayOpen` is set at midnight and rides the save (an old save opens the day at
the till it came back with, which reads `+$0` rather than a phantom fortune).
`incomeRate()` is still called for its side effect: it is the only thing that
prunes `earnHist`.

Measured, not counted: the label is dropped rather than the number when a rich
town makes the pair too wide for the 52px between the SHOP tab and the SAVE
chip. Worst case checked at `-$123.5K`.

### 5. THE TILL BOARD — where the money comes from, said in the town

Matt: *"maybe it's not obvious enough that the crab shack is the central place
money comes from?"* The nav strip answers that on the MAP (tallest block, only
gold one, only named one, dead centre). This answers it at STREET LEVEL: a
board chalked **TILL TODAY $295** hung on your own shopfront, going up while
you watch the plates go out, flashing in step with the strip off the same
watcher.

It takes the slot the CLOSED placard uses and cannot fight it (that branch is
`!bizOpenNow`, this one is the else). It is on YOUR shops only — a peer's
takings are not your business and have never been on any surface the player can
read. And it reads `today.biz[key].take` through `navTill`'s **plain lookup**
rather than `bizDayBook()`, which would CREATE a day-book row for a shop that
has not traded and put a phantom line in tonight's report.

### 6. THE MUSHED TEXT — and the third sweep

Matt: *"the tips slider is mushed up with the other text; might be a couple of
instances like that."* There was, and this is the cause: the SCHEDULE tab's
right-hand column ran **TONIGHT $92** (y+45), **TOWN/PIER** (y+54), a
**"TAP A ROW"** hint (y+60) and the slider's own readout (y+66) — four strings
at a 6px pitch in a 5px font, none of them technically overlapping, all of them
unreadable as a group. **The existing sweep cannot see this**: it fires on two
pixels of overlap and this was one pixel of gap.

The hint went, because it was already said — the foot of the same card carries
the full sentence, next to the roster it is about. That leaves the slider's
readout a row of its own.

**AND THE OTHER TWO INSTANCES, which the sweep found once it was pointed at a
LONG NAME.** The character card prints the crab's name at x29 and its mood
right-aligned to x104, and nothing measured the gap - so **PLANKTON PETE
printed straight through DOWN**, and TIDEPOOL TIM through it on the visitor's
card. Both had a `slice(0, 9)` where a measurement belonged, which is the exact
guess-about-a-proportional-budget this file already has a paragraph about; the
5x7 font simply had no `fitSmall` equivalent, so **`fitText` is new**. The
reason it survived this long is the fixture: every sweep ran the card on
`crabs[0]`, who is PINCHY, six characters, and the row only breaks at about
ten. The sweep now runs it on the widest name in `CRAB_NAMES.concat(
CUSTOMER_NAMES)` against the widest mood, measured rather than typed - so a new
name added to the roster is checked the day it lands.

**AND THE OTHER CLASS.** Three of the SCHEDULE card's footer sentences were over
budget and were being silently cut off by `fitSmall` — a line that fits because
its tail was removed still reads as a sentence nobody finishes. New scenario
**"no fixed sentence on a card is trimmed to a pair of dots"** sweeps the copy
that is WRITTEN (help pages, tooltips, hire card, roster hints) against the
game's own rect tables, and leaves alone the copy that is ASSEMBLED (menus,
report lines, ballot lines out of crab names) — trimming is the right answer
for those, which is what `fitSmall` is for. `rosterHint()` was hoisted out of
the draw so the suite measures the same strings the card prints rather than a
copy of them.

### The receipts

- **Two real pre-existing bugs found by the extended sweep and fixed**: a long
  crab name printing through its own mood on both character cards. See the mush
  section - the fix is `fitText`, and the sweep now uses the roster's widest
  name so it cannot regress quietly.
- **13 new scenarios** (the suite goes 167 -> 180), all mutation-tested. The three worth naming: the
  tooltip promise is verified by BUYING the thing and re-reading the counter;
  the hire pointer is verified by PANNING THE CAMERA and checking it moved by
  exactly as much the other way (a pointer parked at a screen coordinate passes
  "it drew" and fails that); and the help card's character set is checked
  against `FONT_SMALL` itself.
- **Both existing UI sweeps extended.** The overlap sweep gained all eight help
  pages, all seven tooltips, the hire card, and — a class it had never been
  pointed at — **WORLD text on a shopfront** (`drawBusiness`, at midday so the
  till board is actually up). Mutation-tested by moving the till board onto the
  MANAGE chip: caught, both as text-on-text and as rect-on-text. The off-canvas
  sweep gained the same surfaces plus the nav chip row.
- **NOT swept: the management card's HALL tab.** It was being rebuilt in
  parallel (polling day) and a finding there would have been stale before it
  was read. It is the one full-screen surface neither sweep covers.
- **Balance untouched by construction.** Every line of this is draw and input.
  The one new piece of state the sim can see is `dayOpen`, which nothing reads
  but the panel, and the one read INTO the sim (`today.biz[k].take`) does not
  write. `tryBuy` is unchanged; the arming lives in `tapShopButton`.

### Rejected

- **A help card that stops the clock.** Built, then removed the same day on the
  ruling above. It is the pause button under another name.
- **An advisor / projected income / "recommended" purchases.** The thing that
  would most obviously have "fixed" *"is my money going up?"*, and the thing
  PLAN explicitly says not to build.
- **A tooltip in the panel under the shop grid.** Measured: the second button
  row ends at y237 of 240. There are thirteen rows there and a tooltip needs
  thirty-six.
- **An edge pointer to the shack** when it is off camera. The nav strip already
  names it and the till board already speaks; a third answer to the same
  question is clutter.

## Backlog (rough priority)
- **THE FIRST OUTSIDE PLAYTEST (2026-08-19), verbatim.** Matt's friend, new to
  the game, played the opening. This is the most valuable feedback the project
  has ever had and it is quoted in full because paraphrasing would sand off the
  specifics:

  > *"press new game. wall of text. whats going on!? I need a hook, but click
  > on anyway. click through and theres pinchy and claudi. What do they do??
  > NOBODY KNOWS. Meanwhile theres a clock ticking. PAUSE ANYONE? I'm losing
  > time here and I want to pay back my landlord! Go to the shop. WHAT DO THESE
  > THINGS DO? TOOLTIP TIME! Hired a crab. Don't even see the crab. He just
  > joined the crew. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? Is my money going up? Its too
  > unclear!"*

  Broken out, every one of these is a real defect and not a taste question:
  1. **THERE IS NO PAUSE.** `ffMode` cycles 1x/2x/3x/6x and never stops. A
     simulation whose clock cannot be stopped punishes a new player for
     reading its own UI. This is the biggest single miss.
  2. **The lease card is a wall of text with no hook** — it is the first
     screen, and it explains terms to someone who does not yet care.
  3. ~~**"What do they do?? NOBODY KNOWS"**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-20**: the
     HELP card's page 2 is exactly this question ("THE CRABS: what they do
     for you, what they need"), and page 1 says what the shack is for.
  4. ~~**"WHAT DO THESE THINGS DO? TOOLTIP TIME!"**~~ — **shipped
     2026-08-20**: every rung of the shop grid now carries a tooltip with
     what it does, what changes, and what it costs you every night after.
     See the onboarding-pass entry.
  5. ~~**Hiring has no visible consequence**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-20**: the
     camera snaps to the new hire, a pointer bobs over their head, and a
     card says who they are and what they will cost at 20:00.
  6. ~~**"Is my money going up?"**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-20**: the $/S slot
     now reads TODAY +$159 (coins - dayOpen), which is history rather than a
     forecast. The BILL chip is still the other half of the sum.
  Note what he got RIGHT with no help: *"I want to pay back my landlord."* The
  rent goal lands. It is everything around it that does not.

- **THE SAME PLAYTESTER, AFTER PLAYING ON (Ben Lewis, 2026-08-20), verbatim:**

  > *"strangely compelling"*
  > *"the secret sauce is incomprehensible UI and punishing you for not
  > understanding at pace"*

  Half a joke, and the most useful sentence anyone has said about this game.
  He stayed. The pressure is doing real work — so the UI pass has to be built
  around a distinction the earlier notes did not draw:

  **TWO KINDS OF NOT-KNOWING, and only one of them is a bug.**
  - **INTERFACE OPACITY IS A BUG.** Not knowing that right-click redirects a
    crab, that `[` and `]` cycle, that the trade ledger hides inside the job
    board, or what a shop upgrade actually does. Nobody learns anything from
    this; they just lose. Fix all of it.
  - **ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IS THE GAME.** Not knowing whether a third crab
    pays for herself, whether tonight's rent clears, whether to buy the grill
    or the tables. That tension IS the compulsion he is describing, and a UI
    pass that resolves it — projected income, "recommended" purchases, an
    advisor telling you what to do — would sand off the thing that made him
    stay. **Do not build that.**

  The PAUSE added 2026-08-20 is the shape of the right fix: it does not remove
  the pressure (rent still falls at 20:00, the day still runs out) — it removes
  the PUNISHMENT FOR READING THE INTERFACE. Aim every UI change at that line:
  make the machine legible, leave the economy frightening.

- **A UI PASS AND A HELP SCREEN (Matt, 2026-08-19):** *"need a pass at the UI
  and perhaps a help screen; my friend says the UI isn't so intuitive."* This
  is the project's FIRST outside playtest signal — a person who did not build
  it could not read it. Before designing anything, get the friend's specific
  moments (where they stuck, what they expected, what they tried); a redesign
  aimed at the wrong confusion is worse than none. What is measurably
  undiscoverable today, from a build-session audit — every one of these is a
  real feature with NO on-screen affordance:
  - ~~**RIGHT-CLICK to redirect a crab**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-20**: it is on
    the HELP card's controls page, with the rest of the keys.
  - **KEYS**: `m` mute, `n` music, `b` next track, `f` fast-forward, `[` / `]`
    cycle crabs, arrows pan, `Escape` backs out. All undocumented in-game.
    (Arrow-key panning is no longer the ONLY way around town — see the nav strip
    entry — but the keys themselves are still unlisted anywhere.)
  - **THE TRADE LEDGER LIVES INSIDE THE JOB BOARD.** A player looking for the
    town's imports has no reason to click a HELP WANTED board. ~~Likewise the
    **census is a tab inside the management card**~~ — **half-shipped
    2026-08-20** by the nav strip: the census (and the management card) now have
    a front door on the HUD, and the card retitles itself TOWN CENSUS when you
    arrive that way. The TRADE LEDGER is still filed behind HELP WANTED.
  - **`MORE>`** is the only hint that a crab has a full dossier and a diary
    behind the character card.
  - **The little sun** fast-forwards to morning; the **`>> >>> >>>>`** chips
    are speeds. Neither says so.
  - **The goal is not stated anywhere** — deliberately, since the ferry office
    only appears once the arcade is fitted, and the town's name is embargoed
    until the ending. A help screen must respect BOTH: it can teach the
    controls without naming the island or spoiling the win.
  The last point is the constraint that makes this interesting: the game hides
  its ending ON PURPOSE, so "explain the game" and "keep the reveal" have to be
  satisfied at once.
- ~~**THE DEPARTURE CARD (Matt, 2026-08-19)**~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-08-20**, see
  the feature section "THE DEPARTURE CARD" at the foot of this file. The
  original entry, kept because it called the design exactly right: *"we should also have a view at
  end of day of folks leaving on the ferry and how they are feeling, with a
  'quote' based on stats."* The visitors already carry everything this needs —
  purse and spend, buys, nights, `roughNights`/`unhoused`, the rage-quit path,
  their room, and a per-visitor LOG (`visLog`) of what they actually did. So
  the card is a READING of data that already exists, not new simulation. The
  quote must be DERIVED, never random: a guest who slept on the sand, one who
  stood at the counter until they gave up, one who left with $6 of the $158
  they brought, and one who never found anything open should each say something
  only they could say. Same editorial rule as the devlog — individual named
  crabs, specifics over aggregates. Pairs naturally with the nightly report
  (`drawReport`), which already owns the end-of-day moment.
- **A SURF SPOT, mid-beach (Matt, 2026-08-19, queued behind the beach ball):**
  *"i was thinking there needs to be a surf spot kind of right in the middle,
  but one thing at a time."* Explicitly deferred by him; the beach ball comes
  first. Both belong to the same want: **better sources of LIMITED fun**, so
  that boredom has answers other than the paid arcade and the very costly
  chatter. Whatever the surf spot is, "limited" is the load-bearing word — a
  free unlimited cure for boredom would flatten the arcade and the need with
  it.
0. **Two small text nits, both spotted 2026-08-19 and both left alone on
   purpose** (a suite run costs 20 minutes on a loaded machine, and neither is
   worth invalidating one): (a) the diary's serve line is `"SERVED A " +
   ITEM_NAMES[icon]`, and `roomkey` is `"A ROOM FOR THE NIGHT"` - so the
   Driftwood's own keeper writes *"SERVED A A ROOM FOR THE NIGHT TO EBB"*. The
   article belongs to the item name (every other surface reads correctly with
   it), so the fix is at the SERVE site, not in the table. (b) `OFF_BASE` still
   has no `juicebar` row - flagged when the hotel landed without one, still
   true, still one line.
1. ~~**Business settings**~~ — **shipped**: shop hours + the management screen
   (2026-08-18), per-business and per-crab WAGES (2026-08-19, "THE WAGE IS A
   SETTING"), and per-business **PRICES** (2026-08-19, with the rivalry — it
   followed the wage's `goingRate` pattern exactly: a setting is only real if
   somebody responds, and tourists respond to boards). Still open from the
   original idea: **staffing rules**.
2. **More peer owners moving in** — the owner layer makes this content, not
   surgery: an OWNERS entry + BIZ entry + an NPC crab. Fish market buying
   wholesale off the pier is the natural next one. **Half-shipped 2026-08-19**:
   succession already mints peer owners at runtime (a fisher buys the failed
   shower house and the registry grows), so this is now only about NEW LOTS.
   **And they have AMBITION since 2026-08-19**: a peer owner next door can come
   for one of the player's businesses, and the player can buy theirs. A new lot
   inherits all of that by pointing `RIVAL_CFG.SHOP`/`PRIZE` at it.
3. **Player-avatar crab** — make `owner: "player"` also a walkable crab.
4. **Fishing expansion** — hire fishers directly; fired/unhired crew return to
   the pier; weather/catch variance; quotas; a boat (see trade horizon T4).
5. ~~**NPC eviction / move-outs**~~ — the rent half **shipped 2026-08-19**:
   an NPC owner no longer skips rent when short. They draw the line exactly as
   the player does, and three missed settlements CLOSE the business and put it
   on the market (see the failure/succession entry). Still open: NPC mortality
   (a CS4 item — the succession block leaves it a one-loop seam).
6. ~~Staff-bused table service for a fancier restaurant tier~~ — **shipped
   2026-08-19** with the table-service economy (see the feature entry).
7. Cosmetics — mostly **shipped**: pier plank art (boardwalk over the east
   break, pilings, railing, night lamp, perched gull), closed-eye sleep
   sprites with breathing + Z drift, taller shower stalls (curtain with a
   feet gap), grill smoke, shower suds, beach memorials now actually drawn,
   dossier portrait/flavor-line polish, gull-cry + catch-splash sfx.
   Post-ship incident (Matt: "crabs stuck in the shower", fixed same day):
   (a) the bather vignette drew from claim time, showing a head in an empty
   stall during the walk-over — now gated on state === "showering" (ea65082,
   which also added the real walk-in/out movement); (b) a crab dying
   mid-errand (or NPC-hired mid-errand) leaked stall.occupant forever —
   cleaners require !occupant, so the stall deadlocked for the run. New
   abortErrand() releases stall/table/claim/ghost customer on both paths
   (ef5b5a6); suite soaks 2 days asserting no stall stays occupied past a
   real cycle (30/30).
   Remaining: followable-NPC polish. ~~Shower stall entry~~ — **shipped**
   (Matt 2026-08-18): the bather is now visible in the stall — head bobbing
   over the curtain in their own shell colors, white eyes, feet in the gap
   (already there), suds rising while the water runs. The crab entity stays
   hidden=true during showerT (out of collision/painter); the stall draw
   renders the bather from t.occupant.
8. ~~Secret mobile merge mode~~ — **shipped**: touch-only hidden mode (hold a
   crab until the thought bubble fills), per-crab boards, goal ladder pays
   into the till ($60/session cap). Lives in merge.js, desktop-inert.
9. ~~Portrait-phone canvas~~ — **shipped**: portrait viewports get a 256x288
   canvas (index.html sets `SCREEN_H` before ppu.js derives `H`; a mode-flip
   on rotate reloads, losslessly, after a 250ms settle). The world keeps rows
   0..PANEL_Y in every mode; the extra 48 rows go to the panel — 16px tabs,
   34x34 crew cards with 2x portraits, 80x26 shop buttons, 8px menu pitch —
   via TALL/TAB_Y/ROW_Y/CARD/BTN_H consts that evaluate to the old numbers on
   240 (desktop frame is pixel-identical; verified byte-identical
   screenshots). Merge mode's cell height and button lanes now derive from H
   too. Headless sim never sets SCREEN_H, so the suite runs on classic 240.

## Feature requests (Matt, 2026-08-18, unscheduled)
- **Fishing experience** (Matt: "fish-catching should give experience").
  Fold into the existing accomplishments framework (dishes: knack at 25 /
  famous at 100 / master at 250, toast + follow-card line) — count each
  crab's lifetime catches (catchesBy already tracks per-name in stats;
  make it per-crab persona state so it saves) and grant fishing tiers at
  the same milestone shape: e.g. knack = a touch faster casts, famous =
  +double-haul odds, master = the rare BIG ONE (bonus fish / bonus price).
  Under floating fish prices an experienced fisher earns visibly more —
  which feeds the housing ladder and the boat, and gives SALTY vs DRIFT
  a career arc the devlog can follow. Tourists at the pier watching a
  master land the BIG ONE wouldn't hurt either. Natural build slot: the
  price-discovery agent (fishing economics, same code) or immediately
  after it.
- ~~**Town census — all-crab character menu**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-18**
  as the TOWN tab of the management screen (see the labor policy suite
  bullet). Original request preserved:
- **Town census — all-crab character menu** (Matt: "need an all-crab
  character menu to review basic stats of whole pop"). A population
  screen: every crab in town — crew, townsfolk, NPC owners — one row
  each with the basics at a glance: name/portrait, job + employer, shift
  & day off, wallet, housing (house/boat/cot), health (sick day N /
  well), need bars in miniature, PACE, OT/day-off status. Sort/filter by
  job, housing, sickness, wallet. Tap a row → that crab's dossier (and
  selects them, per the selection decouple). Natural home: a POP/TOWN tab
  next to CREW/SHOP/MENU, or reachable from the job board. Pairs with the
  scheduling menu — census for reviewing, scheduling for acting.
- **Decouple selection from camera follow** (Matt: "we can't order crabs
  around cause when you drag it deselects them; need to be able to select
  a crab without it focusing basically; should focus till click away, then
  keep select but lose camera"). Today follow-cam IS selection (followIdx)
  and any drag/pan clears it — so you can't line up a right-click order
  while panning to the destination; the order system fights the camera.
  Spec per Matt: clicking a crab SELECTS it and focuses the camera;
  clicking/dragging away releases the CAMERA but keeps the SELECTION
  (visible highlight — ring/outline under the crab + their card stays up);
  right-click orders go to the selected crab from anywhere on the map.
  Click empty ground / Esc / selecting another crab changes selection.
  Follow-cam can be re-engaged from the selected card. UI-layer only, no
  matrix; touches the same input layer as right-click orders and merge-mode
  hold — mind the 6px drag threshold lessons.
- ~~**Labor policy suite: sick days + overtime + scheduling menu**~~ —
  **shipped 2026-08-18** (see the systems bullet above for what landed and
  what it measured). Original request preserved:
- **Labor policy suite: sick days + overtime + scheduling menu** (Matt).
  Three pieces, one family, built on the management screen:
  - **Sick days** — a sick crab can take the day off, UNPAID, to care for
    themselves. Rest at home should genuinely help: this is the moment to
    close the known "cared" seam (recovery's cared check reads only
    hunger+dirt — predates thirst/tiredness; a sick day in a real bed,
    hydrated, should hit the 40% recovery lane, else staying home is
    theater). Interacts with shift coverage exactly like weekends'
    single-worker DAY OFF placard.
  - **Overtime** — already specced this morning (see earlier entry: ~1.5x
    premium, needs/health cost, dossier control, visible OT powerup marker
    + follow-card tag). Its prerequisites (stats→performance, T1) landed
    long ago; it rides in this bundle.
  - **Scheduling menu + auto-management** — a scheduling screen (likely a
    management-screen tab): shift assignments, days off, OT requests, sick
    day approvals. Ships WITH an auto-manage mode built on legible
    convergent rules (the SUDSY hours pattern) so CPU owners run the same
    policies the player can — and lazy players can delegate. CPU
    participation is the point: NPC shops grant sick days and post OT by
    the same rules the player sees in the menu.
  All balance-moving (labor supply changes on every axis) → full matrix;
  sick days probably shift the illness-duration distribution left, which
  is the intended payoff — measure it for the devlog.
- **Music off by default, but sell it** (Matt): ship with music muted for
  new players (SFX stays on), and actively encourage flipping it on — e.g.
  a small pulse/glow on the MUS toggle early on, or a one-time toast at a
  calm moment ("THE BAND IS WARMED UP - MUS TO LISTEN"), plus the NOW
  PLAYING banner already selling track titles. Existing saves keep their
  current choice; the encouragement shows only while music is off and
  gives up after a few sessions rather than nagging.
- ~~Stop the table-bumping~~ + ~~Route optimization / trip-chaining~~ —
  **shipped together (worktree, 2026-08-19)** as ONE pass over the
  locomotion/errand-dispatch layer (both directives are the same code; the
  originals are kept below for the record).

  **The chaining rule, as shipped** — one comparison per candidate stop, no
  path search. `pickErrand` now GATHERS every stop the crab could make right
  now (the old priority order survives as `ERRAND_RANK` food 4 / drink 3 /
  clean 2 / fun 1) and takes the best

      score = (rank + need level) / (1 + detour / DETOUR_SCALE)     [400px]

  where the DETOUR is only what the stop ADDS to the walk that was happening
  anyway:

      detour = |here → stop| + |stop → anchor| − |here → anchor|

  `anchorX(c)` is where the trip ends regardless: the workplace while a shift
  is coming or under way, home the rest of the time. A stop ON the route
  scores its full urgency (detour 0); a stop the other way costs twice the
  backtrack. Escape hatches, both deliberate: a need past **DIRE (0.9)**
  ignores geography entirely (desperate crabs walk), and the
  "don't-backtrack-the-promenade-before-9-AM" rule drops any stop more than
  **DETOUR_MAX (900px)** out of the way *while a crab is at home with a shift
  ahead* — it will still be there tonight. Three companion rules do the rest
  of the work:
  - `afterErrand()` sends **anyone** with a shift ahead on to WORK (it was a
    fisher-only shortcut). This single line is what turns "eat, walk all the
    way home, turn round, walk back past the shack" into "eat en route".
  - `afterErrand()` also **CHAINS**: a second stop within `CHAIN_PX` (260px)
    of the way onward happens now instead of after a lap home. Two stops per
    outing, then the schedule takes over — imperfection is charming, a third
    lap is not. A bounced queue never chains (you were not served).
  - A **shift-end crab takes their staff meal at the counter they are standing
    at** (`startSelfCook` at the pendingOff branch). Refusing it there was the
    entire reason a crab walked home across town at 15:00 and back to the same
    dark kitchen at 20:00 to cook it.

  **The avoidance mechanism** — lane travel was furniture-BLIND, and commutes
  did not route at all: `stepTo(dest, y=167)` drew a straight diagonal from
  the front room (y≈155) to a shop door, which crosses the entire front row of
  counters *for the whole trip*. That one line was most of the town's bouncing.
  Now `solidBands()` mirrors `collide()`'s two furniture passes EXACTLY (same
  x/y tolerances, cached on unlocks + table level), `laneClear(lane, x0, x1)`
  reports a lane's daylight over a span, and `travelLane()` reads
  `LANE_LOOK` (64px) ahead — one comparison — taking the other lane only when
  the near one is under `LANE_PAD` (2px) of daylight and the other is better.
  Commutes, walk-home, the day-off amble and the idle loiter all route through
  it. Two constants moved with measured receipts: the **aisle 147 → 146** (the
  centre of the corridor the furniture leaves — 147 sat 2px off the picnic
  tables) and the **lane merge 3px → 1.5px** so walkers hold their lane
  instead of drifting into the counters over a thousand pixels (that drift was
  a 44-unstick pin on one town). `clearSpotY()` keeps loitering spots out of
  the furniture — the lower idle spot (y=156) sat squarely inside the front-row
  band, which is why SUDSY spent her shift being shoved off her own towel
  counter. The shipped BOUNCE_BUDGET/WARP_PX valve is untouched and now
  almost never fires.

  **Measured — locomotion** (5 days × 4 seeds):

  | town | metric | before | after |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | plain | warps | 34 | **0** |
  | plain | unsticks | 19 | **6** |
  | plain | frames deflected by furniture | 12239 | **2265** (−81%) |
  | plain | distance walked / crab-day | 5115px | **4438px** (−13%) |
  | plain | x-walk / crab-day | 4140px | **3563px** (−14%) |
  | plain | "laps" of own territory (mean / median) | 2.20 / 1.79 | **1.91 / 1.32** |
  | arcade (4 crabs, 4 seeds) | warps | 19–25 | **0** |
  | arcade | unsticks | 6–11 | **2–9** |
  | arcade | x-walk / crab-day | 4147–4286px | **3506–3706px** |

  A "lap" is `x-distance walked that day ÷ 2 × (that day's x-span)`: home →
  work → home is exactly 1. The median crab-day went from nearly two laps to
  1.32.

  Scripted single-crab probe, the SAME hungry-crab-at-home construction driven
  in the browser on both builds (CLAWDIA, home x134, shack queue x1570, shack
  door x1247, shift 14-20):
  - **before**: home → shack (1436px) → **all the way home again** (x141, at
    15:21) → then out to work (2948px cumulative when the work leg starts) —
    about **4050px** to eat a plate of fish and clock in.
  - **after**: home → shack (1436px) → straight on to work (1513px cumulative
    at the work leg) — about **1840px**, and she is on the bike to the door,
    fed, at 13:29 for a 14:00 shift. **2.2x less walking for the same day.**
    (shots/before-chained-trip.png vs shots/after-chained-trip.png.)

  Scripted single-crab probe, same walk both builds (x890 → x977, straight
  past SUDSY's towel counter): **before 421 frames, 222 of them deflected
  (53%), 412 spent inside the counter's solid band, 50 GAME-MINUTES for 90
  pixels, ending shoved up over the counter at y=148.6. After: 49 frames, 0
  deflected, 6 game-minutes, out on the boardwalk at y=167.4.** That 8.6×
  is the "all day" Matt was watching. (shots/before-towel-counter.png vs
  shots/after-towel-counter.png — the clock in the corner reads 09:56 vs
  09:06.)

  **Measured — balance** (`--jobs 4`, this tree, before vs after):
  - Baseline 30d × 8: 0/8 both. Evictions **7,8,10,11,11,11,12,14 (median 11)
    → 9,10,10,11,12,12,12,13 (median 12)**. +1 median, tails tightened at both
    ends. This is the documented drift: commute time is work time, so saved
    claw-miles are recovered crab-hours — same shape as the auto-unstick fix.
  - Growth 40d × 8 `--buy chef,table`: **0/8, evictions 6,7,7,9,10,10,11,16
    (median 10) → 2/8 survive, evictions 11,11,12,27,33,37,41,41 (median
    33).** This is a BIG move and it is NOT tuned away (standing policy: a
    behaviour fix's balance consequence gets documented, not neutralised).
    **FLAG FOR MATT**: this bumps hard against "escape-as-rare stands for the
    moment". A growth town that no longer spends a third of its crew-hours
    walking in circles is simply a better-run town, and the honest levers if
    escape should come back down are the deliberate ones named in the
    escape-as-rare entry (spawn pacing / rent), chosen on purpose — not
    re-crippling the routing.
  - Six-seed 8-day service probe: **5/6 → 6/6 towns alive, 881 → 905 tourist
    serves, mean crew hunger 0.174 → 0.190** (crabs eat marginally later
    because they no longer make a special trip for it, but they eat).

  **Suite: 69/69**, four new `routes:` scenarios, all four verified RED on the
  pre-pass build:
  - `routes: a meal ON THE WAY to work, not a lap of the promenade` — builds
    the named symptom (hungry crab at home, shift ahead, shack on the way) and
    asserts BOTH the path order (never turns back toward home between the meal
    and work) and the distance (≤ 1.25 × the ideal home→shack→work walk).
  - `routes: a full town walks less per crab-day` — 4-crab arcade town, 5 days:
    was 4273px of x-travel per crab-day, now 3521; gate 4000.
  - `routes: furniture avoidance keeps warps + unsticks near zero` — same town:
    was 21 warps + 6 unsticks, now 0 + 2; gates 2 and 8.
  - `routes: both travel lanes are clear of every solid (tripwire)` — fails the
    day somebody parks a table or a counter on a travel lane, which is exactly
    how the town got into the all-day-bouncing state in the first place.

  **Re-pointings (3, each with its receipt written into the scenario):**
  1. `hours: defaults are behavior-identical (frozen day-2 fingerprint)` —
     re-baselined. Receipt: this pass deliberately moves where every crab
     walks, so every position and every downstream number moves, and the drift
     runs the right way on BOTH seeds — coins 159.7→198.7 and 208.4→218.3,
     rep 46.7→52.5 and 51.1→52.6, tourist rage 5→3 and 3→3, serves 37→38 and
     34→38 — and both fishers now actually FINISH the walk home by midnight
     (seed 1337's DRIFT used to be stranded at x1549 mid-promenade; he now
     sleeps at his cottage).
  2. `thirst: drink errand serviced end-to-end at a staffed juice bar` —
     the fixture, not the assertion. Routed commutes shifted its 750px
     cross-town walk by a few minutes and landed the crab on a full line,
     which legitimately bounces a local ("LINE'S TOO LONG") and left the
     wallet check measuring a settlement instead of a drink. The crab is now
     stood at the bar's door with the unclaimed tourist line cleared; the
     retail-pricing transaction under test is unchanged.
  3. `staff meals: closing crew cooks their own dinner, at retail` — the
     fixture parks the crab AT THE SHACK instead of at home, which is what
     "the closing crew" always meant. (Kept honest: an earlier draft of this
     pass ALSO gated the staff meal on standing at your own counter; measured
     6-seed, that starved crews whose kitchen goes dark — 5/6 towns alive vs
     6/6, mean hunger 0.233 vs 0.190 — so the gate was dropped and only the
     fixture moved.)

  **Devlog beat (organic, reproducible)**: seed 1337 (`node tools/headless.mjs
  --days 5 --seeds 1`), **PINCHY, day 3**. Before: clocks off at 21:10, walks
  1011px home to his lot at x520, arrives at 22:25 — and immediately turns
  round and walks 860px BACK to the shack grill at x1382 to cook himself
  dinner, getting there after midnight. After: he cooks it at the counter he
  was already standing at and makes exactly one walk home, in bed by 21:43.
  Shots: `shots/before-towel-counter.png`, `shots/after-towel-counter.png`,
  `shots/before-picnic-tables.png`, `shots/after-picnic-tables.png`,
  `shots/after-chained-trip.png`.

  **Left on the table** (measured, deliberately not taken): the boardwalk lane
  has only 2px of daylight under the front row because `FLOOR_MAX` is 168 and
  the counters' solid band ends at 166. A probe at `FLOOR_MAX` 170 with the
  boardwalk at 169 cut the residual deflection a further 25%, but that changes
  the walkable floor of the whole town (framing + the draw layer), which is
  outside a locomotion pass. Worth a look if the bouncing ever reads as
  "still too much".

- **Stop the table-bumping** (Matt: "crabs keep running into tables...
  too much. It's cute if it's just for like 10 minutes but all day? that's
  terrible"). Root cause is structural: routedStep travels exactly two
  lanes (y=147/168) chosen with NO furniture awareness, and solids are
  resolved REACTIVELY (walk into table → get pushed out) rather than
  avoided — so any table on/near a lane makes every passing trip a visible
  bounce, forever. Direction: proactive avoidance — make lane travel
  furniture-aware (pick the lane, or a brief detour-y within the lane
  band, that clears the solids ahead), or carve stable gap waypoints
  through the picnic area. Keep the occasional bump (charm), kill the
  constant plowing (terrible). PLUS Matt's last-resort valve: a crab that
  has been obstructed ~30 IN-GAME MINUTES cumulative on one trip gets a
  tiny warp — a few pixels, just past the blocker, ideally on a frame
  where they're behind furniture so it reads as squeezing through, maybe
  with an "EXCUSE ME" quip. (Different scale than the 1.5-real-second
  unstick watchdog: that breaks pins; this caps a trip's bounce budget.) Coordinates with the trip-chaining agent
  (same locomotion layer) — likely same worktree or immediately adjacent
  in the queue.
- **Route optimization / trip-chaining** (Matt: "folks are taking weird
  routes, like waking up, going to work, then going to the crab shack;
  folks should optimize their routes a bit!"). Crabs pick errands by
  need-priority alone and ignore geography — classic symptom: wake →
  commute to work → walk BACK past home to the shack for breakfast →
  return to work. Direction: trip-chaining, not TSP — next stop = best
  urgency/detour-cost ratio, eat en route when the shack lies along the
  commute, don't cross the town twice for chainable stops. Imperfection is
  charming; backtracking the full promenade before 9 AM is not. Behavior
  change only, but re-run the matrix: commute time is work time under the
  performance system, so saved claw-miles are recovered crab-hours —
  expect median drift like the unstick fix; document, don't tune away.
  AGENT SPAWNS after price-discovery lands (both touch errand dispatch;
  builds serialized).
- **Fish price discovery** (Matt, on the fishers-break-for-anything collapse:
  "we can't force folks to work like that! This is a sign that the price of
  fish is artificially low"). Directive: replace the lunch-and-thirst-only
  labor restriction with a PRICE mechanism — the restriction was a
  command-economy patch on a price problem. Design sketch:
  - Pier fish price FLOATS with scarcity (townCatch vs recent demand),
    bounded above by the $7 import price — the world price is the natural
    ceiling, which is the trade-horizon stub doing real economic work.
  - Fisher WAGES ARE ABOLISHED (Matt: "it's not a real thing. I've never
    heard of it before; they're always paid based on catch as free agents").
    The flat $13/day subsistence goes away entirely — a fisher's income is
    the catch sold at market price, full stop (keep the $2/catch
    housing-fund flow). Output = income: a scarce-fish day is a lucrative
    day and a lazy week is a hungry one, so free crabs return to the pier
    because it pays, not because they're forced. NOTE the safety valve
    already exists: a broke, hungry fisher roasts one of the catch — the
    driftwood fire is what makes zero-wage survivable at the bottom.
  - RESTORE full fisher freedom (breaks for fun too — self-employed means
    self-employed; "I'VE GOT MY OWN LIFE" applies to fishers most of all).
  - Job board already provides labor-supply response: fishing postings when
    price runs high pull drifters to the pier.
  - Watch for: price oscillation (hog cycle) in the sim; shack margin under
    floating input costs; interaction with the escape-as-rare baseline.
    Full matrix. First real price mechanism in the game — the doorway to T5
    exports (exports need prices to mean anything).
- ~~Fish price discovery~~ — **shipped (worktree, 2026-08-18)**, built to the
  directive (price mechanism replaces the labor restriction; fisher wages
  ABOLISHED outright per the follow-up — "they're always paid based on catch
  as free agents"). The game's first real price mechanism:
  - **Clearing rule** (`settleFishMarket`, once a day at midnight): 3-day
    windows of landings (`trade.landH`) vs fish eaten (`trade.useH` — local +
    shipped-in + beach roasts; an import IS unmet local demand). Demand
    outrunning landings by >1/day steps the price +$1; landings piling up
    >2/day past demand steps it −$1. Band $2 (floor) to $7 (FISH_IMPORT —
    at the ceiling the world market supplies and imports still charge a flat
    $7, so local can never exceed world). Starts at the classic $4.
    FISH_LOCAL is gone; `ingredientCost` charges `trade.price` while the
    pier has fish.
  - **Money flow**: the market-stall abstraction buys every landed fish at
    `trade.price` (fisher wallet credit at the splash — no wage, no floor,
    no housing stipend) and sells to any fish-consuming kitchen at the same
    price via ingredientCost. Its fee is absorbing spoilage (fish paid for
    that rot at the 4-crate midnight clamp) and the fishers' own roasts;
    injection is bounded by price x (landed − eaten), self-damping because a
    glut is exactly when the price is at the floor. Consumers pay $13-16
    retail > $7 max fisher take per fish: no infinite loop.
  - **Full fisher freedom** restored: the pressing-needs gate is deleted; a
    fisher breaks for ANY need. The price pulls them back: (1) fun breaks
    are skipped at price >= $6 (one comparison; hunger/thirst always walk)
    with the "THE WATER'S MONEY TODAY" quip, once a day; (2) a WORKING
    fisher's lunch is the roast — eating a $2-7 fish on the spot beats a
    $15 town lunch plus hours of walking at any price, and it's the safety
    valve that makes zero-wage glut weeks survivable (never the town's last
    2 fish, unchanged); (3) `afterErrand()` sends a mid-shift fisher
    straight back to the rail — the old errand→home→pier odyssey (~3000px)
    was the measured cause of the original supply collapse.
  - **Labor answers price both ways**: a job-board posting only tempts a
    fisher while the wage beats ~5 fish at market (ties go to the steady
    paycheck, so the flush-SUDSY hire still works at launch prices); a
    price pinned at the ceiling a full day posts HELP WANTED: THE PIER,
    and a day unfilled pulls a drifter off the bus (fishSpotFor() grows
    the rail past 3 spots, 14px per wrap).
  - **UI**: notice-board trade card gains PIER FISH PRICE + a 30-clearing
    sparkline (green in-band, orange at ceiling); catches pop "CATCH! +$N".
    Price/series/windows/ceilDays roundtrip save/load; old saves open $4.
  - **Stability measured** (8 solvent seeds x 30d): band held 2-7 on every
    seed, $1 max daily step by construction, mean price 4.4-5.7; full
    floor-to-ceiling traverses after day 5: 0-2 per seed in 3.6 weeks
    (bound asked: <= ~2/WEEK). The hog cycle exists but swells over
    ~10-14 days, damped by the 3-day window + $1 steps + drifter entry.
  - **Balance measured**: baseline 30d x 8: 0/8, evictions 8,8,8,9,9,10,
    10,11, median 9 (was median 10 — one inside the ±2 band); growth
    chef,table: 0/8, 7,8,8,9,10,10,10,15, median 10 (unchanged, and a new
    day-15 tail). Growth towns DO get squeezed by design (scarcity pins
    their price at $7; the suite growth floor recalibrated 6,7,9,13 →
    7,7,8,9 on its own seeds). Fisher income 1.7-5.4x the old $2/catch
    (avg $4.2-5.7/fish); both founding fishers house themselves at day-2
    settlement now (was day 5-8 or never); SUDSY's take dips ~10% (fishers
    hold the pier more). Suite 59/59 — re-pointing: boat scenario pins
    thirst, tired scenario pins SALTY to a cot, growth floor above; 6 new
    fish-market scenarios (ceiling+imports, glut+pay, opportunity cost,
    15-day band, save/load, roast-carried glut week).
  - **Devlog beat (organic)**: seed 6685, arcade-town (coins 3000, arcade +
    2 chefs day 1), day 9 ~9:56 — SALTY, bored 0.8, wallet $16, price $7,
    skips the arcade for the rail: THE WATER'S MONEY TODAY. Shots:
    fish-price-trade-card, fish-price-ceiling-posting, waters-money-today,
    catch-at-market-price under shots/.

- **(numbers superseded 2026-08-19** by THE SLEEP DIRECTIVES in the
  needs-failure entry: TIRED_SHIFT 0.45 -> 0.60, TIRED_DRAIN 0.5/0.25 ->
  0.30/0.10, TIRED_NAP 0.4/0.2 -> 0.24/0.08, and the accrual is continuous
  through the shift instead of a lump at knock-off. Everything below is the
  shape, which is unchanged.**
- ~~Tiredness replaces sandiness~~ — **built (worktree branch, 2026-08-18),
  after the T2 merge as sequenced**: `p.sandy` renamed `p.tired` with save
  migration (old sandy seeds tired, crew + townsfolk paths, nothing strands).
  Accrual: +0.45 shift end, +0.05 nightly ONLY on days worked (workedToday
  flag; fishers/NPCs/owners identical — equality directive), +0.03 per
  errand, nothing from idling. SLEEP repairs it: proportional drain while
  bedded down at night — own bed (house/boat) 0.5/game-hour, shelter cot
  half that. Same-schedule contrast from 0.8: housed wakes 0.037, cot 0.213
  (suite-pinned); organic 4-seed steady state: housed wake med ~0.07,
  evening peak med ~0.59 (SUDSY's arcade nights pin her at 1.0 — she sleeps
  4.5h). Showers are DIRT-ONLY (needsBath drops the sandy term, errand files
  under clean, stall no longer resets sandy); SUDSY's economy holds — dirt
  alone keeps her stalls busy (449 vs 453 showers / 4x20d). Sickness: tired
  ≥ 0.95 → +0.05 (was sandy +0.03), blamed "exhaustion"; T2's thirst
  coupling rewired to tired > 0.5 checked PRE-bump at shift end (same firing
  rate as the sandy original); tip-fumble term follows the rename at 0.85
  (evenings routinely reach the old 0.66). Deliberately NO crabEff tired
  term — a future loosening with its own matrix run. UI: ZZZ bar on the
  follow card (both canvas modes), RESTED in the dossier, EXHAUSTED mood at
  0.85, DEAD ON MY FEET quips; the old darkness "TIRED" mood renamed UP
  LATE. Measured: baseline 16 seeds 11-23 med 15 (was 10-21 med 14), 8
  seeds 11-23 med 15 (was 10-16 med 13) — runway eases ~1-2 days because
  crew keep the shower money sandy forced out while sleep is free; growth
  chef,table 1/6 escapes, same eviction days. Suite 44/44.
- **Per-owner everything; all crabs equal** (Matt 2026-08-18): "no public
  utilities, no town payroll — per-owner … all crabs should be equal in the
  simulation, they just start with different stuff." Language pass done
  (job-board card now reads WHO WORKS FOR WHOM, PAID BY <owner>). **Brick
  laid 2026-08-18 — hiring-as-recruitment**: a hire is no longer minted
  with a free house; a tourist, a drifter and a new hire all enter the sim
  the same way (homeless at the shelter, climbing on wages), and a tourist
  can now BECOME a crab (conversion keeps their name/shell/accessory) —
  founders differ only in starting stuff (they open housed in lots 0/1,
  sanctioned). Still unequal after this pass: NPCs CANNOT die (crew can);
  NPC_WAGE 20 vs CRAB_WAGE 23; tourists while merely visiting remain a
  separate entity class (no needs/wallet/trait until converted). Direction:
  one simulation contract for every crab, differing only in starting
  assets/relationships.
- ~~Click-to-nav + right-click redirect~~ — **shipped 2026-08-18** (see the
  "Right-click orders" systems bullet). Suite 41/41 (scripted-redirect
  round trip + a deterministic still-vs-mover pin the watchdog must beat —
  verified the pin reproduces with the watchdog disabled). Balance: 8-seed
  baseline 0/8 both, evictions 10-19 med 13 -> 9-19 med 15 — inside the
  documented per-build wobble, direction consistent with fewer lost
  crab-hours; no price tuning. Later loosenings if wanted: townsfolk orders,
  touch gesture, a real context menu.

- **Line of credit** — **built (worktree branch, 2026-08-18), tight landing**:
  all knobs in game.js CREDIT_CFG (LIMIT 120 ~ half a night's shack rent,
  RATE 0.25/night compounding, MIN_PAY 80 auto-collected). Rent shortfalls
  draw on the line via one settlement hook (settleCreditLine, pure math shared
  by player + NPC + forecaster); exhausted line + missed obligations =
  BANKRUPT (the new game-over; NPC owners instead go dark 2 nights, debt
  written off). Bankruptcy prediction: forecastBankruptcy() replays upcoming
  settlements at the day-ledger run rate (pessimistic min(3-day avg, latest));
  chip at horizon <= 5 days, toast at <= 3. Measured 30d x 8 seeds: baseline
  median 12 (8-16) -> 13 (10-19), 0/8 both; toast lead >= 2 days in 7/8
  doomed seeds, chip lead >= 3 in 8/8. Suite 37/37 (4 new credit scenarios).
  Loosening stays stepwise per the original spec below.
- *(original spec)* **Line of credit** (Matt): business owners (player and NPC alike) can take
  a default *compounding* line of credit at a standard rate (rate is a play
  knob, tuned later). Deliberately SHORT — small limit, quick repayment.
  **Missing a loan payment = bankrupt** (this replaces/absorbs the current
  miss-rent-and-die: rent shortfalls draw on credit, so the loan becomes the
  real cliff). Must include **bankruptcy prediction**: project till + income
  rate against upcoming bills + debt service and show the player a warning
  IN ADVANCE of the cliff (the headless buyer's reserve math — cost +
  tonight's bill + cushion — is the seed of the predictor). Rollout knob:
  start financing so tight it's barely different from today's curve
  (measured — the landing commit should be near-inert like T1), then loosen
  release by release until it's fun. Balance-critical: eviction-day metrics
  are THE baseline stat, so every loosening step needs its own matrix run.
- ~~REMOVE the laundry mechanic~~ — **shipped 2026-08-18** (Matt: "not
  natural in any way now that we have showers"). SUDS N BUBBLES is gone:
  BIZ/UPS/busy entries, recipes, towel/uniform items, washer/dryer/basket
  art, the merge-mode laundry chain, the intro lease line, the tourist
  weight, the wash-cycle water flow. CLN servicing folded into showers —
  pickErrand sends a grubby crab to the taps at dirt ≥ 0.66 (the old
  cleaners threshold; a shower's −0.5/−0.7 keeps dirt below the sickness
  "cared" line). Shop grid: _biz1 is now arcade/cadegear; the vacated slot
  is EMPTY until the **juice bar lands with T2 thirst** (next pass, which
  also owns the retune). Save migration: stale lv keys ignored, stale job
  "cleaners" clamps before any BIZ deref (crew → shack, npc → pier), an
  owned laundromat refunds $400 (+$150 sudsgear) exactly once via a
  persisted sudsRefund flag. Measured: the eviction curve is BIT-IDENTICAL
  before/after (0/8, evictions 8-16, median 12; growth 0/6, 8-12, median
  11) — dirt accrues in 0.25 steps and showers subtract 0.5/0.7, so no
  crab ever organically landed in the old 0.66-0.75 gap; the fold is a
  safety net, not a curve change. Suite 35/35.
- ~~**Overtime**~~ — **shipped 2026-08-18** inside the labor policy suite
  (1.5x premium, needs cost via the existing accrual, dossier + SCHEDULE
  controls, coffee-cup powerup + follow-card/dossier tags). Original spec:
- **Overtime**: the player can request a crew crab work overtime for extra
  pay. Design seams: shifts already exist (shift D/N on personas), wage is a
  constant (22) paid at settlement — overtime = staying past shift end at a
  premium rate (say 1.5x), at a needs/health cost so it's a real trade-off
  (tired crabs get dirty/hungry/sick faster — the stats→performance work
  slots straight in here). Control could live in the dossier next to
  TAP: REASSIGN. Balance-moving → needs the headless matrix; sequence it
  after T1 with the other economy stages. **Visible OT powerup**: a crab on
  overtime must be readable at a glance to everyone — a little powerup
  marker on the sprite (think coffee-cup / lightning bolt over the shell,
  same family as the merge-mode thought bubble), plus an OT tag on the
  follow card / dossier.

## MERGING THE VISITOR PASS (2026-08-19) — three resolutions worth keeping

The tourist/hotel branch was cut five commits back, and two of its conflicts
were the dangerous kind: the merge was *clean-looking* in both directions and
wrong in one.

1. **THE PRICE WAR NEARLY DIED IN A DELETED BLOCK.** The visitor model retires
   the reputation-paced spawn timer — and that timer was where the board price
   moved the promenade (`bizPull` = pull x `priceAppeal`). `visPick` chooses by
   NEED and DISTANCE, so taking the branch's side wholesale would have left
   `priceAppeal` orphaned, silently ending the price war *and* falsifying the
   rivalry numbers measured the same afternoon (a rival cutting her price would
   have taken nothing off the shop next door). Resolution: the appeal term now
   multiplies the visitor's score in `visPick`. It is **zero sum by
   construction** now — the boat decides how many guests land, the price
   decides whose door they walk through — and `priceAppeal` is exactly 1 at the
   default price, so an unrepriced town is bit-identical.
2. **A VISITOR PAID A DIFFERENT PRICE THAN THE SHOP WAS CREDITED.** The branch
   debited `recipe.pay` from the wallet while `creditBiz` took `menuPrice`.
   Below the default price that MINTS money on every sale and above it burns
   it — i.e. a price war would have been a money printer, against the pass's
   own no-inflation invariant. Both sides now use the board price.
3. **TWO BOATS, TWO PHRASES.** The day boat's arrival toast said "THE FERRY IS
   IN" — the exact words the win condition pops. The win now says "THE FERRY IS
   YOURS", because what happened is that she changed hands.

Balance after the merge, measured here: baseline **0/16, median 11**; growth
**2/8** and **3/8** on the second block (5/16 across both, against 6/16 before
the pass — and the pre-pass build reads 4/8 then 2/8 on those same blocks, so
eight growth seeds is a coin). Suite 139 scenarios.

**Left open, deliberately:** `juicebar` still has no `OFF_BASE` row, so its
staff rest on Mondays by fall-through (the same fault that gave the hotel's
REEF the town's opening day off). Fixing it moves measured juice-bar curves, so
it wants its own pass with its own re-measure.

**One for Matt: HOW MANY BOATS ARE THERE?** The town now has a day boat that
docks four times a day with visitors, a freighter on the horizon when the
ledger books an import, a Thursday crossing on the far channel, and a $20,000
FERRY that is the win condition. Two readings, both coherent, and the answer
changes the fiction: either the boat you buy IS the one that has been bringing
you tourists (you buy the crossing you have depended on — which is what the
ending card already says), or the day boat is a local excursion and the
mainland ferry is a different vessel entirely. Not resolved in code; the
language is merely kept distinct so either reading still works.

## Conventions
- **`shots/` IS UNTRACKED (2026-08-19).** Agent screenshots are how an agent
  shows its work in a report; they are not published content. Two of them were
  the ENDING CARD — the entire closing text plus "CRABALINA IS ON THE MAP" —
  sitting browsable in a public repo, which is precisely what the embargo
  exists to prevent, and 79 files had accumulated by default. `shots/` is now
  gitignored; anything the devlog needs is harvested into `devlog/img/` and
  committed deliberately. **Note the limit honestly:** removing them from HEAD
  does not purge them from git history, and the name unavoidably ships inside
  `game.js` anyway — this makes the reveal far less discoverable, not secret.
  Whether that is enough, or whether history should be rewritten, is Matt's
  call. (Older PLAN entries referencing paths "under shots/" still describe
  real local files; they are simply no longer in the repo.)
- **TEXT IS MEASURED, NOT COUNTED (2026-08-19).** Two bugs in one evening had
  the same shape: a string budgeted in CHARACTERS against a slot measured in
  PIXELS. The intro lease printed four of its six terms past the card and one
  clean off the canvas; the management card's menu line was 34 characters
  sliced for a "100px" slot and was actually 135px, printing 13px past the
  right edge of the screen. Both were invisible to 132 scenarios and obvious in
  one screenshot. The receipt is now general: scenario **"no surface prints off
  the canvas"** stubs `text`/`smallText`, draws every full-screen surface
  (intro, title, character card, panel, dossier, diary, all three management
  tabs, job board, save, game over, ending) and fails on anything crossing x=0
  or x=W. Trim with **`fitSmall(str, maxW)`**, which trims by width and appends
  ".." — never with `.slice(0, n)`. And take a screenshot: the sim cannot see
  a layout, only a measurement you thought to make.
- **Devlog** (DEVLOG.md + devlog/img/, owned by the coordinator session):
  patch-notes-as-little-stories in the Minecraft-notes voice — bugs and
  features framed as things that happened to the town. Each entry carries
  lots of screenshots (playwright driver in the coordinator's scratchpad;
  serve on :8931, arrow keys pan the cam 24px/press) and a "Tales from the
  sim" section narrated from a seeded headless run. **Editorial rule from
  Matt: keep the focus on INDIVIDUAL crabs — named crabs doing specific
  things beat aggregate stats for stories.** Build sessions: ping the
  coordinator after merge batches so entries stay current.
  Shot-staging notes learned the hard way: stage saves clear of the 20:00
  settlement or the day report + NOW PLAYING toast photobomb the frame;
  the music-nudge toast fires ~19:06 and lands in horizon shots; evening
  horizons are cleanest staged at tmin 1140 with no clicks (clicking to
  dismiss can drop you to the title); mistPeak is a day-hash so a
  clear/thick pair is chosen, not waited for (day 11 ≈ 0.25 is a good
  night, day 37 ≈ 0.8 a thick one); the crab cycler lives in the CHARACTER
  CARD header, so shoot the card, not the top-right. **There is no pause
  and no speed of zero** (ruled out on purpose), so a frame cannot be held
  across an await: kill requestAnimationFrame on the page, then drive
  frame() yourself with synthetic timestamps — frame(last) gives dt of
  exactly zero, which is the only way to stop the clock for a shot. Console staging:
  `UPS.arcade.lvl = 1; coins = 20000` opens the ferry office and greens
  the fingerpost. **Re-verify a UI screenshot after any UI merge — a
  published shot of a moved control is a stale doc.**
- Suite green before push; economy changes need a matrix re-run.
- Big features → fork subagents in git worktrees (they don't push; the parent
  reviews screenshots + suite output, merges, re-verifies, pushes).
- Balance work happens in the sim, not by intuition — measure, then tune.

## THE ILLNESS-ROLL CLOCK ARTIFACT (investigated 2026-08-20, worktree) — MEASURED, AND DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED

**Matt:** *"clawdia still has supercrab powers of never getting sick btw, she
keeps making all the money."* The standing diagnosis (STATE OF PLAY, "NEXT UP")
was a clock artifact in the nightly sickness roll — it reads every crab's needs
at the **instant** of the 20:00 settlement, which is late in a MORNING crab's
day and early in an EVENING crab's — with a measurement attached: *morning
crabs ill 9.2% of the time against evening's 1.9%.*

**The mechanism is real. The 9.2 / 1.9 is not, and did not reproduce in any rig
this was measured in.** The pass therefore ships a MEASUREMENT and a RECEIPT,
not a rewrite. Behaviour is byte-identical: the 16×30 matrix comes back with
every number the same, and the frozen day-2 fingerprint was never touched.

**AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME.** Matt's "*still* has supercrab powers" is the
giveaway: the same complaint, read the same way ("the owner read it as 'CLAWDIA
is OP'; she was simply the E-shift founder"), was investigated and fixed on
2026-08-19 — sleep only repaired tiredness while `darkness() > 0.7`, so a
morning crab lost recovery an evening crab kept, and `TIRED_NAP` was added and
tuned by an M/E shift-fairness probe. The suite gate from that pass ("tired: the
morning and evening shifts end the week level") still holds at a mean gap of
0.007 over six seeds. **The clock half of the shift problem was already fixed;
what remains under the same words is CLAWDIA herself.**

### What was actually measured

New rig: **`node tools/shiftill.mjs [--seeds N] [--days D] [--crew N]
[--organic] [--swap] [--dump PATH]`**, driving the real game through simlib and
reading the roll's own view of the town through a new `window._stats.rollLog`
seam in the settlement (armed only when a rig asks; consumes no RNG; there is a
suite gate proving a logged town is byte-identical to an unlogged one).

Only the CREW has an M/E shift — townsfolk and fishers are all `D` — so the
default rig hires the crew to six through the game's own `hireCrew()` (which
alternates M/E by crew size) and keeps the town solvent, the same shape
`tools/illness.mjs` uses. 12 seeds × 30 days = **2124 crew crab-nights**, ~1060
a side.

**THE HALF THAT IS TRUE — the roll reads a systematically different crab
depending on the shift.** What the roll actually sampled:

| shift | hunger | thirst | dirt | tired |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M | 0.263 | 0.483 | 0.481 | 0.579 |
| E | 0.152 | 0.266 | 0.446 | 0.693 |

A morning crab carries **1.7× the hunger and 1.8× the thirst** of an evening
crab at the moment of judgement. It is not soft: the settlement runs at the TOP
of `frame()`, before the crab loop, so an E-shift crab (14:00–20:00) is still
`working` when the roll reads them, and their whole clock-off bump — hunger,
thirst, **+0.25 dirt** — lands *after* it, every night, with the 45-minute
last-call grace window on top (measured: an evening crab's day routinely
finishes at 20:45 or later, a full hour on the far side of the judgement).

**THE HALF THAT IS NOT — it never reaches the outcome, because the two halves
of the artifact point in opposite directions.** The morning crab carries the
day's hunger and thirst into the roll; the evening crab carries the day's
EXHAUSTION into it (0.693 vs 0.579 — they are read minutes after a six-hour
shift, where the morning crab has had an afternoon of `TIRED_NAP`). Assembled
into risk they cancel:

| | M | E | M/E |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean risk the roll assembled | 0.00906 | 0.00926 | **×0.98** |
| prevalence (nights ill) | 2.96% | 2.59% | ×1.14 |
| incidence (new illnesses/at-risk night) | 2.00% | 1.52% | ×1.32 |

on 21 and 16 events respectively. **PINCHY (M) was ill on 1.94% of 360 nights
and CLAWDIA (E) on 1.39% of hers** — and in 16 ORGANIC towns × 30d (the losing
town the player actually meets, ~170 nights a side) it runs the *other* way:
PINCHY 0.00%, CLAWDIA 2.41%, risk ×1.12 in M's favour. The ratio wanders
between 0.75 and 1.12 across trajectories at ~180 crab-nights an arm, i.e. the
whole effect is noise. There is no supercrab.

### The experiment that settles it: swap the founders' shifts

`--swap` exchanges PINCHY's and CLAWDIA's shifts on day 2 and changes nothing
else, so the question becomes a clean one: does the gap follow the SHIFT or the
CRAB? 12 seeds × 30 days, 360 nights each, both arms:

| | PINCHY | CLAWDIA |
|---|---|---|
| **as shipped** | M — ill **1.94%**, risk 0.02123, 4 illnesses | E — ill **1.39%**, risk 0.02213, 3 illnesses |
| **shifts swapped** | E — ill **3.61%**, risk 0.03103, 7 illnesses | M — ill **2.50%**, risk 0.02317, 4 illnesses |

**The gap follows the crab.** PINCHY is the sicker of the two on mornings *and*
on evenings; CLAWDIA is the healthier one on evenings *and* on mornings. The
roster-wide ratio meanwhile shrugs: M/E risk ×1.01 as shipped, ×0.93 with the
founders swapped — a shift is not a thing that happens to you. (Honest sample
note: these are 3–7 illnesses per cell. The *direction* survives the swap; the
*size* of it is a coin, and the number with power in it is the ×0.98 risk ratio
above.) Mean wallet at the roll is $12 vs $11 as shipped and $12 vs $12 swapped
— "she keeps making all the money" does not show up as a savings gap either,
because both founders spend what they earn on the same needs.

### Two candidate fixes, measured on the same 4658 rolls, both rejected

Every recorded roll was re-scored under each candidate rule (`--dump` writes the
raw roll log; a throwaway scoring script reads it), so the three rules are
compared on **identical** crab-nights rather than on three separate
simulations. The `hours` and `peak` columns came from a throwaway build that
banked them per crab alongside the same seam — six lines in `tickNeglect`,
reverted with the rest; rebuild it there if this is reopened.

| rule | M/E | town-wide mean risk |
|---|---|---|
| **shipped**: one instant sample at 20:00 | **×0.98** | **0.01678** |
| the crab's own-day **PEAK** | ×1.03 | 0.03632 (**+116%**) |
| **hours banked** over each line / 6h (the exposure integral) | **×1.43** | 0.02241 (+34%) |

- The **exposure integral** — the obvious "judge their own day" fix, and the one
  the brief pointed at — is **worse on the very thing it was meant to fix**. A
  morning crab spends **2.48 hours a night** over the exhaustion line against an
  evening crab's **1.41**, because they finish work at 14:00 exhausted and stay
  awake for six hours, while an evening crab finishes at 20:00 and goes to bed.
  That is a real difference in a real day, not a clock artifact, and integrating
  over the day *surfaces* it instead of removing it. (It was built, shipped into
  a working build, and measured end to end: 16×30 came back 0/16 with median
  eviction 12 but a different tail, and town-wide infections 58 → 61. Then it
  was reverted, because ×1.43 is worse than ×0.98.)
- The **peak** rule is as fair as what we already have and **more than doubles**
  the town's illness. Buying nothing for a full retune of the four most
  documented numbers in the health model is not a trade.

**So the roll stays as it is, on purpose.** The bar for anyone who reopens this
is **×0.98**, not "better than nothing".

### What CLAWDIA actually has

Founder identity, fixed in `crabs.js` and nothing to do with her shift.
`FOUNDERS` is a constant: PINCHY is always index 0 (**SPEEDY**, move 1.4, work
1.0, tip 1.0, on foot) and CLAWDIA always index 1 (**TIDY**, work 1.1, tip 1.05,
on a **bike**), and `makeCrabPersona` alternates shifts by index, so
CLAWDIA is on evenings in every seed there has ever been — which is exactly why
"evening" and "CLAWDIA" are impossible to tell apart by eye. She works 10%
faster, tips 5% better, and rides at `MODES.bike` 75 where PINCHY walks at
`crabMove` 40 × 1.4 ≈ 56. *"She keeps making all the money"* is the observation,
and it is about the crab, not the clock — **the `--swap` arm above is the test
that separates them, and it is the one to re-run if this comes back.**

### What shipped

- `tools/shiftill.mjs` — the rig, kept, with the finding written into its head.
- `window._stats.rollLog` in the settlement roll — the seam, off by default,
  RNG-free, with a suite gate proving it inert.
- `illRisk(c)` — the roll's four need lanes split into a named function so a rig
  can read them without re-implementing them (the sim contract), carrying the
  full receipt above it.
- `devlog/img/2026-08-20-illness-roll-clock-artifact.png` (what the roll reads
  vs what comes out of it) and `.../2026-08-20-illness-roll-three-rules.png`
  (the three candidate rules on the same 4658 rolls, plus the founder swap) —
  drawn with the game's own 5x7 font, because the honest picture of this pass
  is a distribution that refused to move.
- Three suite scenarios under `THE ILLNESS-ROLL CLOCK ARTIFACT`: the ordering
  probe (an evening crab is still on shift when the roll reads them, and their
  clock-off bump lands after — a KNOWN unfixed property, pinned so the next
  person has to read the receipt rather than rediscover it), the roster outcome
  gate (M/E within 0.4–2.5 on the live rule), and the seam-is-inert gate.

### Left undone, on purpose

- **`careLane()` is the same class of read** and was not touched: it decides the
  cure/death lane from `hunger >= 0.5`, `dirt >= 0.66`, `thirst >= 0.5` at the
  same 20:00 instant, and the morning crab's instant hunger (0.263 vs 0.152)
  sits in exactly that band. It was left alone because it lives next to the
  shelter pot, it moves deaths rather than infections, and this pass's whole
  finding is that this shape of read is not, in fact, biasing the outcome. If it
  is ever revisited, measure it the same way — `rollLog` is one field away from
  carrying the lane.
- **PLAN's STATE OF PLAY still lists the illness roll under "NEXT UP"** with the
  9.2/1.9 numbers in it. Left for the coordinator to retire, because the top of
  this file is being edited by several sessions at once.

## ACCOMMODATION UPGRADES (shipped 2026-08-20, worktree)

Matt's directive, verbatim: *"Also now we have two multi accommodation places;
need to be able to make each pretty big by buying upgrades."*

The town has two buildings that sleep more than one crab and both were frozen
at the size they shipped. They grow now, and **the whole design is in who signs
for the growth, because that is who pays for it.**

### THE TWO HALVES ARE DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT
| | THE SHELTER | THE DRIFTWOOD |
|---|---|---|
| what it is | town property, RENTED off Mr. Pincherton | a commercial lease with an owner |
| who decides | the MAYOR (the player's chip when they hold the office, a policy when they don't) | the OWNER (the player's chip when they hold the lease, a policy when BRASS/REEF/a fisher does) |
| what it costs | **$3 a night, forever**, out of the town fund - plus the first night as key money on the day | **$80 once** out of the till, **plus $4 a night on the lease, forever** |
| what gates it | THE PURSE THE TOWN VOTED FOR | the till, tonight, with a payroll floor left in it |
| how big | 4 beds -> 12 | 7 rooms -> 13 |

### THE SHELTER HAD NO WALL AT ALL, and that is the fault this pass found
`homeSpot` cycled four cot positions with `index % 4`, so the fifth homeless
crab slept inside the first and the twentieth slept inside the fourth. The one
building the entire town hall exists to pay for had **infinite capacity**. It
has four beds now - the four the sprite has drawn since the day it shipped -
and the crab who finds them taken **sleeps rough on the step**, through
`sleepRough()`, the state the bolted-door path already models and prices (no
rest banked at all, which arms the next morning's sickness roll).

**Who gets a bed is TENURE**, off `p.nCot`, the nights-at-the-shelter counter
`logNightly` has always kept. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
- roster order would hand every bed to the player's crew (crabs come before
  npcs in `allCrabs`), so the player would never once feel the wall they are
  being asked to pay to move. **The pinch has to land on the hire.**
- everybody's counter ticks on the same nights, so the ORDER never churns:
  "the crab who has slept here longest keeps their cot" is stable, testable and
  arguable from the dossier.

### THE PURSE IS THE GATE, and that is the politics
The fund **cannot save up** - `fundNeed()` strikes the purse to one night's
bill and nothing more, by design - so a capital cost for a bed would simply
mean the shelter could never grow. What gates a bed instead is a forward test:
**would the purse the town voted for still cover the shelter's bill with this
bed on it?** (`dormTake()` - a whole day's `purseYield`, recorded once at
settlement so the player's chip and the CPU mayor's policy read the identical
number rather than a half-finished morning's levy).

Measured on four 40-day growth towns: a town on **RENTS 20%** raises about the
rent and no more, and cannot add a single bed; the refusal says so by name
(*"THE RENTS WON'T CARRY $16 A NIGHT"*). A town on a **LEVY** can carry three
or four. Three of the four towns got to five beds and stalled there, which is
the honest answer: **the shelter is as big as the town's politics.** The player
who wants a twelve-bed dormitory has to win the office AND set a purse that
bills their own shack for it - the conflict of interest the mayor pass built,
now with something to buy.

**AND THE BEDS COMPETE WITH THE BOWLS.** `platBowls` only counts the soup a
platform can pay for AFTER the roof, and `platValue`'s roof term is binary
(`purseYield >= shelterRent()`), so every bed walks into the next election:
suite-pinned, a twelve-bed shelter makes a platform that used to cover the roof
stop covering it, and the ideal platform of a homeless voter moves with it.

### THE DRIFTWOOD GROWS INTO ITS OWN FORECOURT
The back wall is FULL (the linen press at 2206, the last door ending at 2428,
the queue standing at 2432) and **there is no upstairs**: `FLOOR_MIN` is 126,
so a crab cannot walk to a landing and a room a guest cannot reach is scenery.
What the hotel does have is a forecourt - the front row at **y158**, the row
the shack keeps its tables in, on the same solid band (149-164) that leaves
both travel lanes their daylight by construction. So it puts up **CABANAS**,
six of them at a 26px pitch from x2266, and you can count them from the
promenade. They are `stalls` like the rooms are, so the housekeeping dispatch,
`freeRoom`, the wedge guards, the asking price's per-fixture term and the
save's room index all grew with them and none of them had to be told.

**The CPU owner's signal is the mirror of the hotelier's.** BRASS answers an
unmade bed (`today.roomsLost`) with a WAGE, because that is a bed her laundry
cost her. A guest bedded down on the sand with **every room LET** is a bed the
house does not HAVE, and that is answered with a cabana (`annexe.short`, a
running tally of guests rather than a nightly reading - a guest beds down at
21:00 and the books close at 20:00, so a nightly counter would be read a day
late or not at all). Keyed on the LEASE, so REEF builds on it too.

### BALANCE - measured before and after on this tree
| matrix | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| baseline `--days 30 --seeds 16` | 0/16, median **12** (7,10,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,12,13,13,13,14,14) | **0/16, median 11** (7,9,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,13,13,18,18) |
| growth `--buy chef,table` 40d x 8 | **3/8** (10,10,11,13,14,41,41,41) | **4/8** (9,10,12,14,41,41,41,41) |
| growth, second block `--seedbase 8` | **1/8** (6,11,12,12,13,14,14,41) | **2/8** (6,8,9,11,14,15,41,41) |
| growth, BOTH blocks (16 seeds) | **4/16** | **6/16** |
| lifetime, baseline | $57,468 | $57,725 |
| lifetime, growth (block 1 / block 2) | $85,551 / $48,232 | $98,480 / $59,390 |

Lose-by-default is untouched (0/16, median inside CLAUDE.md's 11-13 band).
Growth is up by **two towns in sixteen** - inside the band PLAN already
documents for that curve (5/16 and 6/16 either side of the visitor pass), and
the second block was run precisely because CLAUDE.md says eight growth seeds is
a coin. The movement is not free money, it is the hotel's own book: **room-lets
1,051 -> 1,471** on block one and **703 -> 949** on block two, with **visitors
sleeping on the sand 635 -> 458** and **385 -> 363**. A thirteen-room Driftwood
turns fewer people away, which is reputation, which is what fills the boat.
If the escape rate ever needs to come back down, the honest lever is
`ROOM_CFG.RENT` (the landlord's cut of the annexe), not the capacity.

**Rough nights roughly double in a long growth town** (2-19 before, 10-44
after) and that is the new pressure, landing exactly where it was aimed: on the
crabs a growing shack keeps hiring, who all start homeless.

### THE ATTRIBUTION, RE-MEASURED ON MERGED MAIN - AND THE 3/8 -> 4/8 ABOVE WAS THE COIN
Every number in the table above is measured on the BRANCH POINT, before the
town started opening EMPTY (`a new town opens empty, and the first boat brings
the first tourists`) and before the illness and polling passes landed. That
change alone moves the growth curve a long way down, so the pass was re-measured
on merged main as a **2x2 on one build**, 16 growth seeds per arm, using two new
attribution arms on `tools/headless.mjs` (the same idiom as `--nohall` /
`--norival` / `--nohotelier`, but as CONFIG overrides, because both halves of
this pass are pure data):
- **`--noannexe`** sets `ROOM_CFG.EXTRA = 0` - the forecourt holds no cabanas
  ever, so the Driftwood is seven rooms on a $35 lease: the hotel as it shipped.
- **`--nodorm`** sets `DORM_CFG.BASE = 99` - the shelter is bigger than the town
  can ever be, so nobody is ever short of a cot and no mayor ever signs for one:
  the shelter as it was when `homeSpot` cycled four positions with a modulo.

| arm (growth `--buy chef,table` 40d) | block 1 | block 2 | **16 seeds** | unhoused visitors | roomShort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BOTH OFF (the pre-pass world) | 1/8 | 1/8 | **2/16** | 795 | 560 |
| DORM only (`--noannexe`) | 1/8 | 1/8 | **2/16** | 832 | 603 |
| ANNEXE only (`--nodorm`) | 1/8 | 0/8 | **1/16** | 601 | 248 |
| BOTH ON (shipped) | 1/8 | 0/8 | **1/16** | 577 | 235 |

**THE GROWTH PILLAR IS NOT LOOSENED.** Every arm lands within ONE town of every
other over sixteen seeds, and if anything the pass reads very slightly HARDER,
not easier. The 3/8 -> 4/8 in the table above is exactly the coin CLAUDE.md
warns about; the second block happened to flip the same way, and on a build
where the town opens empty the whole comparison collapses into noise.

**THE SHELTER'S WALL DOES NOT BIND IN A TOWN THAT DIES ON DAY 13**, and the
receipt is unusually clean: in block 2, `--noannexe` and `--noannexe --nodorm`
come back **bit-identical** (6,10,10,10,14,14,16,41; lifetime $43,020; 687 room
lets; 412 unhoused), as do BOTH ON and `--nodorm`. A four-bed shelter is exactly
the size of a founding town, so the beds only start to matter once a shack has
been hiring for a fortnight - which is the design, and it is also why the
dormitory cannot be measured on a curve whose median town is evicted on day 13.

**WHAT THE ANNEXE ACTUALLY BUYS, on this build, is not money - it is BEDS:**
visitors who slept on the sand fall **795 -> 601 (-24%)** and guests turned away
from a genuinely full house fall **560 -> 248 (-56%)**, while room LETS barely
move (1,461 -> 1,459). In a short town the Driftwood is queue- and demand-
limited, not room-limited, so more rooms convert rough nights into beds without
adding takings. The revenue only shows up on the long horizon, where the towns
survive to compound reputation - which is where the branch-point block read
1,051 -> 1,471 lets, and it had four towns alive at day 41 to do it with.

### WHAT IT COSTS THE SAVE
Two small keys: `dorm` (beds, the last build day, the streak, the recorded
purse) and `annexe` (the count, the last build day, the tally). The ANNEXE is
written as a **count** and the stalls are rebuilt from it on load - the rooms
are geometry, and a saved array of x's would let a reload land a hut somewhere
a fresh build never would. Loaded BEFORE the visitors, because a guest is
re-hung on their room by index and a guest asleep in cabana 3 must not wake up
outdoors. An old save is a four-bed shelter and a seven-room hotel, which IS
the old world.

### THE ONE SEAM WITH THE TOWN HALL
`SHELTER_RENT` stays a const and gains **`shelterRent()`** beside it; six call
sites read the function instead (`fundNeed`, `platTake`, `platBowls`,
`platValue`'s roof term, `runTownHall`'s `owed`, and the HALL tab's RENT line).
`runTownHall` is otherwise untouched.

### SUITE +9, and every one of them mutation-tested
`shelter: the beds are finite, and the crab with no cot sleeps on the step`
(both arms in one town: four beds and six crabs puts two on the step, the same
night with the beds bought puts nobody there); `shelter: a bed is RENT, not a
purchase` (world money falls by exactly the key money at a NAMED counterparty,
and the next night's remit is the bigger number); `shelter: the PURSE decides`;
`shelter: the BED+ chip is the mayor's, and it sits on the notice without
covering it`; `hotel: the annexe is real rooms` (a guest sleeps in a cabana and
housekeeping turns it over; a FULL annexe leaves both travel lanes clear - the
harshest version of the lane tripwire there is); `hotel: a room is CAPITAL`;
`hotel: a PEER owner builds off turned-away guests, and never out of tomorrow's
payroll` (three arms: signal without money, money without signal, both);
`accommodation: beds, cabanas, the bills they carry and a guest asleep in one
all roundtrip` (plus an old save and a corrupt one); `accommodation: the
shelter's bill is what the town votes on`.

**Mutation tests, all five caught by the intended scenario:** an infinite
shelter (`hasCot` always true), a free bed (`shelterRent` ignoring them), a peer
owner with no till floor, a landlord who takes no cut of the annexe, and a
cabana parked on the boardwalk lane.

### WHAT WAS NOT BUILT, AND WHY
- **No building materials on the trade ledger.** The rule is that resources are
  never conjured, and they are not: the money leaves a real balance and is
  destroyed at Mr. Pincherton, exactly the way every rent in this game already
  leaves the world. The town is not buying timber, it is renting more of a
  building that already stands, and inventing a freighter for it would be a
  fiction the ledger does not need. (`IMPORTS` was also mid-edit in another
  worktree; a table row is the worst-shaped hunk to land twice.)
- **No third row of cot ART.** `cotSpot` stands three rows of four inside the
  footprint (155/145/135 - `FLOOR_MIN` 126 is the ceiling) and draws a bed at
  every one of them, but the crabs are painted over the back rows by the
  y-sorted pass, so a twelve-bed dormitory reads as a full room rather than as
  twelve distinct beds. The LOFT STOREYS above the roofline are what actually
  say "this building got bigger" - one band per row of beds bought, a lit
  window for each bed up there, and the mayor's notice rides up with it.
- **No way to give a bed BACK.** A mayor can commit the town to a bill the next
  mayor inherits and cannot undo, which is a feature: it is the sharpest thing
  an office with two dials can do to a town.
- **No HOURS lever on the annexe**, no per-cabana price (one price on the
  hotel's sign is a suite-pinned invariant), and the player still cannot own
  the hotel and meet BRASS - that is the hotelier entry's own deferral.

## THE DEPARTURE CARD (shipped 2026-08-20, worktree)

Matt, verbatim: *"we should also have a view at end of day of folks leaving on
the ferry and how they are feeling, with a 'quote' based on stats."*

The day report is the money. This is the PEOPLE: at the 20:00 settlement, when
the report goes down, a second card comes up naming every visitor who sailed
today, how they felt, and one sentence each in their own words.

### THE ONE RULE: THE QUOTE IS DERIVED, NEVER RANDOM

A random flavour-text generator is exactly what this must not be. It would be
interface opacity dressed up as personality, and PLAN's second ruling says
opacity is a bug while economic uncertainty is the game. So every sentence is a
reading of something that happened to that guest and that the player could have
stood on the promenade and watched:

> `SLEPT ON THE SAND` ← `roughNights` (and `sandWhy`, asked at the moment they
> lay down) · `$96 OF MY $141 WENT HOME UNSPENT - EVERY LINE WAS FULL` ←
> `wallet`/`purse` and the `full` counter `visPick` writes when it turns them
> away from a four-deep queue · `WAITED 5 HOURS AT THE CRAB SHACK, THEN LEFT` ←
> the wait stamped between `queueJoin` and the rage-quit · `GETTING ON THIS BOAT
> HUNGRIER THAN I GOT OFF IT` ← `hunger` at the gangway **and** `meals === 0`.

Open that guest's diary (`visLog` already writes every one of these events) and
the line is there.

### THE STAY LEDGER — accumulated as the visit HAPPENS

`k.stay` is minted with the purse in `newVisitor` and destroyed with it. It has
to be per-visitor and it has to be live, because **most of what makes a stay
worth quoting leaves no trace in a town-wide counter.** `today.rage` knows three
guests walked out; it does not know MISTY walked out of two lines herself. And
the queue a visitor never joined *because it already held its four tourists* is
recorded nowhere at all — which is the commonest reason a purse goes home half
full, i.e. the single most informative thing the card can say.

| field | written at | what it buys the card |
|---|---|---|
| `waitMin` / `worstMin` / `worstBiz` | `queueJoin` → the serve | "GOT SERVED - AFTER 5 HOURS AT THE CRAB SHACK." |
| `quits` / `quitMin` / `quitBiz` | `visAfterCounter`, unserved | the loudest single act a visitor has (-3 rep) |
| `serves` / `tables` / `meals` `drinks` `washes` `games` `rooms` | `visBenefit` | what they actually bought, and whether they SAT DOWN for it |
| `topItem` / `topBiz` / `topPaid` | `visBenefit` | the dearest thing they went home happy about |
| `tips` | `payAndBenefit` + the table tip | |
| `dues` | `ferryDock`, next to `harbourDues` | "CHARGED ME $3 JUST TO STEP OFF THE PLANK." |
| **`shut` / `full` / `broke`** | **inside `visPick`'s own guards** | **why a want went unanswered** |
| `sandWhy` | `sleepOnSand` | why there was no bed |
| `mistMin` | `visTick`, outdoors after 16:30 | "THE MIST CAME IN AND I NEVER DID SEE THE FAR SHORE." |
| `missed` | `ferryGo`'s last-boat sweep | |

**The two split counters are the load-bearing design.** `visPick` is the only
place in the game that can tell a SHUT door from a FULL line from a board priced
past what this guest is carrying — afterwards the town looks identical in all
three cases. Same argument for `sandWhy`: a full house, a dark hotel desk, a
pile of linen still on the floor and a guest who could not raise the board price
all present afterwards as "an empty room nobody got", and they are four
different problems with four different answers (build / staff the desk / turn
the linen / nothing, they were never yours to lose). Rolled into one number the
card could only ever say *no*, never *why*, and "why" is the whole point of
showing it.

At the gangway `departRecord(k)` freezes the ledger into a **plain row**, which
is the last frame in which anything can be asked of that visitor (`visBoard`
destroys the wallet on the next line). `visQuote(row)` is then a pure function
of a plain object — which is what makes this testable at all: a scenario builds
the stay it wants to talk about and asserts the CLASS of quote, instead of
asserting that seed 1337 happens to produce a particular sentence.

### THE TABLE IS SCORED, NOT LADDERED

Twenty-one rules, each a WEIGHT computed from the row and a LINE. The heaviest
rule speaks. Two guests with the same *shape* of stay but different magnitudes
get different headlines out of the same table, and a rule only outranks another
rule because the thing it describes was actually bigger.

| band | what lives there |
|---|---|
| 120+ | a night on the sand — the only departure that costs the town reputation, and the fix is entirely the player's |
| 80+ | a line they walked out of (-3 rep, the loudest number in the demand model) |
| 70+ | they bought nothing at all, with the sub-line naming which of the three failures it was |
| 40+ | **the purse that went home**, weighted by how much of it did |
| 20+ | the good day: waited on at a table, slept at the Driftwood, spent up, one good plate |
| 1 | nothing happened. Say so honestly rather than inventing colour. |

### THREE CALIBRATIONS, ALL MEASURED, ALL OF WHICH WERE WRONG FIRST

Written down because each was a *plausible* threshold that the data killed —
this is the same "coincidence vs mechanism" trap PLAN records for scenarios,
turned on a display rule.

1. **The long-wait rule shipped at `worstMin >= 20` and had to go to 240.**
   Patience is spent in REAL seconds (`VIS_PATIENCE` 100 at 1/s, six times that
   at an unstaffed counter) and `TS` is 4 game-minutes to the second, so a
   staffed line sat out to the end is **400 game-minutes**. Measured over 266
   departures in three do-nothing towns: the median served guest's longest wait
   is **173 minutes**. A 20-minute bar was the normal service time in this town
   and the rule spoke for nine guests in ten. 240 is "spent three fifths of
   their patience and stayed anyway".
2. **The four need bars each needed a SECOND condition.** `hunger >= 0.8` at the
   gangway is a fact about the clock, not about the town: `VIS_RATE.hunger` is
   0.115/hour, so a guest fed at noon is back over 0.8 by the last boat.
   Measured, "hungry at departure" spoke for a quarter of ALL departures. Paired
   with `meals === 0` — *this guest wanted a meal, and this town never sold them
   one* — it becomes a finding. Same shape for the drink, the wash and the bed.
3. **The unspent purse is TWO rules.** A purse that went home because a door was
   shut, a line was full or a board was out of reach is a town failure with a
   fix attached (`unspent`, MIXED, 40-84). A purse that went home because the
   guest simply stopped wanting anything is a different finding — the town has
   nothing left to *sell* them, which is the standing "better sources of limited
   fun" argument — and it is a shrug (`idle`, FLAT, 22-42). Before the split the
   unreasoned half spoke for 26% of all departures and **drowned every good
   outcome in the table**: SLEPT AT THE DRIFTWOOD was literally unreachable, so
   a well-run town had no way to show green.

And one more that only showed up on the drawn card: **a night on the sand had
ONE sentence**, and on a bad day-2 town (7 of 15 departures) the card printed it
four times on one page — which reads as flavour text however derived it is.
`sandWhy` is the fix, and it is why it exists.

### THE UNSPENT HALF, PRINTED AT LAST

PLAN, the visitor pass: average spend **$29.19 of an ~$85 purse**, and *"the
town is leaving half of every purse on the table because a two-crab shack cannot
serve it, and that is exactly the incentive the growth strategy is supposed to
feel."* Until now the player was never told. The card's money band —
`BROUGHT $1,482   SPENT $673   TOOK HOME $809` — is the first surface in the
game where that number appears, and it appears every single night.

Measured on this tree, and it is the card doing its job: three do-nothing towns
take home **0.55** of every purse; the same three towns played as growth towns
take home **0.38**, `rough` falls from 33% of departures to 17%, `quit` from
13% to 2.5%, and DELIGHTED (a table serve) rises from 2% to 20%. **A good day
and a bad day are different pictures before a word is read** — which is what the
mood strip along the top is for: one pip per guest, sorted into mood order, red
through gold.

### THE CARD

248x158 at x4/y8 (the widest derived line is 58 characters of 3x5 = 231px, and
it has to land inside the margins), the report's second page rather than a rival
to it: the report closes (by its click or its own timer) and this takes its
place, so the end of the day is ONE moment with one gesture through it. Four
guests to a page at 26px — a name, a mood tag, a fact line
(`2 DAYS - SPENT $60 OF $62 - 1 STOP`) and the sentence. Left alone it turns its
own pages and then lets go, on the report's own "nothing is missed" rule: 11
seconds for the first page and **6 for one it turned itself**, because a
measured day sends about twelve people home, which is three pages — 23 seconds
for the whole manifest against the 42 a flat dwell would have cost. A tap gets
the full dwell back, because a page you asked for is a page you meant to read.
Rows are in BOARDING ORDER, not sorted, so the player can match the card to the boats they
watched. The nav strip, the crab cycler and the follow card are all dead behind
it, exactly as they are behind the report.

**The report itself was not touched.** Two surfaces, two subjects; folding the
people into the money card would have cost the report the thing it is good at.

### THE EMBARGO

This is the one surface in the game where the town is described out loud, by
strangers, every night. Nobody on the boat names the island — asserted over the
whole rule table and over everything a full card prints.

### Balance: NOTHING MOVED, and it is proved rather than asserted

A display card must not move the sim. `node tools/headless.mjs --days 14
--seeds 6` is **byte-identical** before and after the whole pass (0/6, eviction
11,11,11,12,14,14, lifetime $22566, roomLets 402, unhoused 256 on both trees).
The only edit inside a hot path is `visPick`'s `add`, which was split from
`if (!visOpen(b) || !visRoomFor(k, b)) return;` into three guarded returns — the
same control flow, no RNG consumed differently. Full matrix on this tree:
`--days 30 --seeds 16` → **0/16, median 12** (7,10,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,12,
13,13,13,14,14), which is the documented baseline.

### Suite 207 -> 220, ZERO re-pointings

Thirteen new scenarios, plus the card added to the two canonical sweeps.
(167 -> 180 at the branch point; 207 -> 220 once merged onto `d0c0e0c`.)

**The merged run is 217/220, and all three reds are INHERITED.** Each one
reproduces on a clean `git archive main` export with **byte-identical numbers**:

| scenario | on this branch | on clean main |
|---|---|---|
| `fish market: scarcity walks the price to the ceiling` | `$324.5 for 46` | `$324.5 for 46` |
| `the beach ball is LIMITED fun` | `chose null instead of the ball` | `chose null instead of the ball` |
| `rivalry: after a refusal she competes...` | dear 46.1% / level 48.3% / cut 44.5% | dear 46.1% / level 48.3% / cut 44.5% |

The rivalry line is worth reading twice: it reports its raw sample counts (bar
190/199/207, showers 222/213/258) and **every one of those integers is the same
on both trees.** That is a stronger statement than "the card changed nothing" -
it says this branch's demand model is bit-for-bit the same simulation as main's,
measured over three 40-day towns, which is exactly what a display card should be
able to claim. The three reds are main's to triage; none is this card's.

`departures: every character the card prints exists in the font` — see below,
it is the one defect here that no assertion could have found first;
`departures: every quote is DERIVED` (a stay built to say X says X, for all 21
rules, plus every rule is reachable — a dead rule is a sentence no player can
earn, which is the same defect as a random one); `the quote's mutation arms`
(fourteen counter-arms: take away the one field the rule is about and it must
stop firing — this is what catches a rule that is really keying on something
else); `the mood on the card is the mood of the rule that spoke`; `three ways to
be turned away are three different counters` (the arms driven through the real
`visPick`: shut hours, a queue stuffed to `TOURIST_QUEUE_MAX`, an empty wallet,
and a control that blames nobody); `the stay ledger is what actually happened`;
`the manifest is the day's own boat-load, and the money adds up`; `the card
waits behind the day report, then pages itself`; `left alone, the card turns its
own pages`; `the card prints inside the canvas and never on top of itself` (an
adversarial manifest — one row per rule, longest name, three-figure money,
longest business name — in BOTH screen heights, every page, with the deepest box
required to land above `PANEL_Y`); `nobody on the boat knows the town's name`;
`a stay survives a save and a reload` (including a ledger-less save, which is
every file written before this pass); `a display card moves nothing in the
town`. The card is also added to the two canonical sweeps (`no card prints text
on top of its own text`, `no surface prints off the canvas`), which is the only
edit this pass makes to somebody else's scenario — two `run(...)` blocks, both
additive.

### THE ONE BUG A SCREENSHOT FOUND, AND WHY IT COULD ONLY BE FOUND THAT WAY

`sGlyph` falls back to `FONT_SMALL["?"]` for any character it does not have,
**silently**. `FONT_SMALL` has an apostrophe and no double quote. So the card
shipped every one of its sentences wrapped in double quotes and drew them as

> `?COULDN'T AFFORD A BED. I SLEPT ON THE BEACH.?`

which reads as a typo in the writing, not as a missing glyph — nothing about it
looks like a rendering fault until you hold it against the source. Two off-canvas
sweeps, an overlap sweep and twelve assertions all passed it, because every one
of them measures strings rather than pixels.

Fixed (single quotes, which the font has) and **closed**: `departures: every
character the card prints exists in the font` walks the whole rule table across
every branch its lines can take, plus everything the drawn card actually puts on
the glass, and checks each character against the font that will print it.
Mutation-tested — put the double quotes back and it fails with
`no small-font glyph for "\""`.

The general lesson for the next card, and it belongs next to the off-canvas
sweep in anybody's head: **a text assertion cannot see a glyph the font does not
have.** Look at the picture.

### The two shots

`devlog/img/2026-08-20-departures-bad-day.png` and `-good-day.png`, and they are
the argument for the whole feature: the same card, the same code, two towns.

| | bad day (seed 42, day 4, `chef:2`) | good day (seed 1337, day 6, `chef:6 table:4`) |
|---|---|---|
| money band | BROUGHT $1190 · SPENT $368 · **TOOK HOME $822** | BROUGHT $1309 · SPENT $898 · **TOOK HOME $411** |
| summary | 6 in beds, **3 on the sand, 4 gave up in a line** | 8 in beds, 4 on the sand, **1 gave up in a line** |
| mood strip | 7 red, 2 grey, 4 amber, **no gold** | 7 red, 3 grey, **1 green, 4 gold** |
| a guest says | *'THE HOTEL DESK WAS DARK. I SLEPT ON THE BEACH.'* | *'WAITED ON AT A TABLE TWICE. A PROPER HOLIDAY.'* |

Neither card was posed: the rows are the real `departQ.rows` from a real
settlement, and the only difference between the two towns is that one of them
bought a chef, tables and a server.

### Shooting notes, for whoever shoots the next card

Four traps, all of which cost an hour each:
1. **`frame()` schedules itself.** Driving the loop by hand queues one rAF
   callback per step; nine thousand full renders fire the moment the loop
   yields and the page never comes back. Stub `requestAnimationFrame` to a
   no-op and be the loop.
2. **The page's own autosave overwrites an injected town** between the write and
   the reload. Stub `save` first.
3. **Headless Chrome only spends its `--virtual-time-budget` while the page is
   IDLE.** An endless paint loop means the screenshot is never taken at all —
   the process just hangs until something kills it. Paint a bounded number of
   frames and stop.
4. **The browser re-serves `game.js` from memory** whatever `Cache-Control` the
   dev server sends, so you shoot the build you already fixed. Cache-bust the
   script URLs themselves (`document.write` keeps the load order).
The manifest is DAY state, so it is not in a save file: build the town in
`simlib`, and carry `departQ.rows` alongside the save envelope.

### Merging it onto main, and the one place the standing rule needs a footnote

Landed on `d0c0e0c` (polling day, the empty opening, the illness pass,
accommodation upgrades, the onboarding pass, the pause removal). Four conflicts,
and **not one of them was safe to resolve by union alone**:

- **`navLive`** — both sides added a reading surface to the same guard. The help
  card and this card are both full-screen; both terms stay.
- **Three of the onboarding pass's new surfaces are drawn AFTER this card and
  had never heard of it**: the shop tooltip, the hire card (y78) and the toast
  band (y62..75) all land in the middle of a 158px card. Each already listed
  every other reading surface, so `departT > 0` simply joins the list — the
  same fix main had just made for `helpView`, one card later. The toast is
  HELD, not dropped, so nothing is lost behind it.
- **`reading` gained `helpView`.** It is the thing that pauses the day's two
  cards rather than burning them down behind something you opened. `departT` is
  deliberately NOT in it: `departTick` is gated on `!reading`, so a card that
  counted itself as "being read" would never close.
- **PAUSE** cost nothing — nothing here ever referenced it.

**THE APPENDED-BLOCK RULE NEEDS A FOOTNOTE.** The standing rule is right: the
shared text after the conflict marker closes only the LAST block, so the block
that goes first needs its own `return true; });`. What bit me is that **the two
blocks did not end the same way** — main's last scenario ended inside a `for`
loop and needed a `}` first, mine ended on a bare `return` and did not. A
blanket tail applied to both produced a clean `node --check` failure at the
seam, which is the GOOD outcome; a subtler pair would have produced a
*swallowed scenario that still parses*. **Count the registered scenarios after
the merge** — 207 + 13 = 220 is the only cheap proof that nothing was eaten.

### Left undone, on purpose

- **No way to re-open last night's card.** It is an end-of-day beat, and a
  history of manifests wants a home (the census? a TOWN tab?) that the
  onboarding/UI pass is actively rearranging. One `depart` object and one timer;
  a re-open chip is a line of click routing whenever somebody wants it.
- **The card is not in the save.** Reload after 20:00 and last night's manifest
  is gone. The stay LEDGERS are saved (that is the part that would otherwise
  lie); the card is a moment, not a record.
- **`visLog` was not extended.** Every quote already has its matching diary
  line, because the events the ledger counts are the events `visLog` was already
  writing. Nothing needed adding to make a quote checkable.

## THE CABANA WALL (Matt, 2026-08-20) — "crabs are getting stuck for a long time"

Matt, playing with several cabanas up: **"with multiple cabanas, crabs are
getting stuck for a long time."** Six probes found nothing, and the sixth one
found it. Worth writing down mostly for how many of the obvious answers were
wrong.

### What it was NOT (all measured, 20 days, seeds 909/1337, 6 cabanas vs 0)

- **Not the unstick watchdog failing.** It fires 0–4 times per 20 days, and
  just as often with no cabanas at all. Nothing was ever hard-pinned.
- **Not housekeeping falling behind.** Thirteen rooms on the same staff: mean
  dirty rooms 2.2 vs 1.9 on seven, zero cleaners stuck. The annexe does not
  outrun its cleaners.
- **Not the check-in queue.** Mean desk queue 0.14 vs 0.11. `queueX: 2432` is a
  static constant — the hotel line has always formed east of the forecourt and
  cabanas do not move it.
- **Not guests stranded walking to a cabana.** `toRoom` never once showed up as
  long-stationary. And visitors are not in `allCrabs()`, so `collide()` never
  touches them: a guest can walk through furniture, but can also never be
  pushed by it.
- **Not the longest freeze in the town.** That is ~900 ticks and it is a
  `toPier` visitor in the ferry queue — identical with cabanas (911) and
  without (904). Legitimately standing still.

### What it was

Cabanas are stalls, and generic furniture claims `y-9 .. y+6`. At the row's
y=158 that is **149–164**, which sits *between* the two travel lanes:

    lane 146 ....... 3px ....... [ 149  CABANA BAND  164 ] ....... 4px ....... lane 168

`LANE_PAD` is 2, so lane 146 counted as clear by exactly **one pixel** of
margin — while `giveBerth` shoves a walker **up to 3px in y in a single
frame**. One jostle from a passing crab put you inside the row.

And there is nowhere to go once you are in it. The bands are 28px wide at a
26px pitch, so they **overlap by 2px**: six huts are not six obstacles, they
are one **continuous 158px wall with no gap**. A crab shoved into it ground
along the whole thing until `BOUNCE_BUDGET` — **30 game-minutes** — finally
warped it 14px past. That is the "long time".

### The fix

A cabana is a hut, not a counter: give it its own band, `CAB_UP = 6`,
`CAB_DN = 4` → 152–162, which leaves **both lanes a 6px margin**, wider than
any single berth push. `solidBands()` and `collide()` share `furnUp`/`furnDn`
so they cannot drift apart.

Furniture-blocked frames inside the forecourt (x2240–2430), 20 days:

| cabanas | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (control) | 2 | 2 |
| 1 | 666 | 105 |
| 6 | 512 | 171 |

Town-wide blocked frames on seed 909 fall 7212 → 5826 against a no-cabana
baseline of 5424 — the forecourt stops being an outlier (band 975 alone
carries 1626).

### The residual, and why it is left alone

What is left is housekeeping in `toStallClean` crossing the row: the collider
exempts a crab from the hut it is *targeting*, but a cleaner descending from
the hotel counter at y≈145 to the boardwalk has to cross the other five. At
~8 blocked frames a day across two cleaners it is now quieter than several
shop fronts nobody has ever complained about. Fixing it properly means
routing the merge-to-lane around the row, which is a general router change and
not worth the risk for this.

### The lesson

**A crab being pushed is not a crab standing still.** Five of the six probes
measured *stationarity* — longest-frozen entity, long-stationary counts,
unstick events — and a crab grinding along a wall is moving the whole time. It
was invisible to every one of them. The instrument that found it in one shot
was `_blocked`, the collider's own "furniture is in the way" flag, which is the
thing the report was actually about. Measure the mechanism, not the symptom
you imagine it produces.

## THE WAGE FLOOR (Matt, 2026-08-20) — "minimum wage setting needs to be a mayoral platform thing"

The fifth dial on a platform, and the first one that has nothing to do with
the shelter. The four purses all answer *who pays for the pot*; the floor
answers *what the lowest day in town is worth*, and it moves money from TILLS
to WAGE PACKETS without the fund ever touching it.

### What it is

`WAGE_FLOOR.steps = [0, 18, 23, 27, 32]` — step 0 is NO FLOOR and is the
founding policy, so a save written before the dial existed reloads paying
exactly what it always paid. The steps straddle `WAGE_STD` (23): two below,
two above, so the ballot can express a floor that binds on nobody as well as
one that binds on everybody.

It is a **floor, not a fourth wage layer**. It sits under `WAGE_STD` →
`BIZ[b].wage` → `p.wage` at the single chokepoint `wageRate()`, it never cuts
a packet, and it never touches what a shop POSTS. That last part is what makes
it repealable with nothing to migrate: vote it away and every till goes back to
the rate it was already advertising, that night. It binds on a PAYROLL and
nothing else — `BIZ[c.p.job]` is the whole test, so a fisher selling their own
catch is untouched.

### The seam it falls on

| who | what the floor does | how they vote |
|---|---|---|
| a crab on a wage | puts $N in their day | **for** |
| whoever signs their cheque | takes $N out of the till | **against** |
| an owner-operator paying themselves | a wash | **indifferent** |
| a fisher | nothing | **indifferent** |

That third row is a rule, not an accident: without `selfEmployed()` excluding
them from *both* halves, SUDSY and REEF both campaigned to pay themselves more
out of their own tills. Gain and bill are priced off the same number — the
raise the floor actually puts in a day — so the money a crab gains is exactly
the money their boss loses.

**The player is on both sides at once**, which is the point. Their own crew
vote their packets up and the bill lands on the same till that pays the lease.

### The bug it shipped with, and the scenario that now guards it

`declarePoll()` rebuilt `hall.policy` **field by field**. The new dial was
campaigned on, reached the paper, and WON — CORAL took the hat on `MIN $32`
with seven votes — and the town went on paying what it always had. It looked
like the feature simply didn't fire, and the ballot dump is what found it:
floors all over the paper, `minWage()` reading $0.

*Any future dial added to a platform must survive
"a platform that WINS actually reaches the office".* Three separate parsers
also read a platform off disk (live policy, the player's manifesto, every
candidate in an un-declared box); a dial only two of them know about loses an
election on reload.

### It is a real politics, measured

35 days, four seeds, once the winner's platform was actually applied: floors
get voted in and voted back out. Seed 77 is the whole arc — `MIN $32` in on
day 7, held through three elections, then REEF (an owner) takes the hat on day
28 and repeals it. Closures across the four seeds went 6 → 8: a $32 floor is a
real cost the town can absorb, not a death spiral.

### Deliberately NOT built: the job-risk term

NPC voting is bimodal — a wage earner always wants the *maximum* floor and an
owner always wants none, so steps 1–3 never win an NPC election. The honest
fix is that a floor its own employer cannot carry lays that crab off, which
the town already models. It is not built because the input would have to be
the employer's takings, and `buildBallot` runs at the settlement (a full day)
while `pickCandidate` runs *during* polling day (a partial one) — the same
platform would score differently at 9am and 9pm, which is a subtle,
day-phase-dependent bug in the one system that most needs to be arguable.

The middle steps are not dead: they are the PLAYER's. An NPC stands on what
they personally want; the player reads the whole town and stands on what will
actually carry AND what their own till can pay. That asymmetry is already the
design note beside the STAND seat in `buildBallot`.

### Where it shows

- HALL tab: a third dial row (the block moved up 16px; the reading surface
  above gave up the same). It reads as a WAGE — `MIN WAGE $27` — not as a step
  index, and beside it the card names how many crabs are under it and what it
  would add to **your** payroll. That bill comes through no fund, so nothing
  else on the card would ever have shown it.
- `policyLine()` appends `/ MIN $N`, which is also the ballot's dedup key — two
  platforms differing only in the floor have to read differently or one of them
  silently vanishes off the paper.
- Help: the town-hall page outgrew itself, so the dials got their own page,
  WHAT THE MAYOR SETS.

## THE HOUSE LIMIT (Matt, 2026-08-20) — "maximum employees per business!!!"

The sixth dial, and the second one that has nothing to do with the shelter.
The floor says what a day is worth; the limit says **how many days one till may
buy**. `HEAD_CAP.steps = [0, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, step 0 = NO LIMIT and the founding
policy.

### It never fires anybody

Matt's standing ruling on this office is that it is local government and
*"they're not gods"*. A cap that reached into a shop and took crabs off the
payroll would be a rug-pull with no answer, so it is a **licensing limit**:

- a shop **at** the line cannot take anyone new on;
- a shop **already over** it is grandfathered and thins out by attrition.

Four doors a crab walks through into a job, and all four are gated: the
player's own hire (refused before the money moves, same shape as
`recruitBites`), the job board, poaching, and the player moving their own crab
between their own shops. That last one steps *past* a full shop rather than
refusing silently — and says so when every other shop of yours is full, because
a control that does nothing reads as broken.

### It is a competition policy, not a labour one

The floor splits the town between labour and capital. The limit splits it
between **big and small employers** — and in this town the biggest employer is
usually the player, so it is usually aimed at them. Measured with seven crew in
the shack: both rival owners (SUDSY, BRASS) campaign for a staff limit, the
player's own crew are neutral (they are grandfathered, so it is worth nothing
to them either way), and crabs with no wage job are **against** it — a limit is
a posting that never goes up on the board.

**EMPLOYEES, NOT BODIES.** An owner-operator at their own counter is not
somebody they hired. Counting them would bite hardest on exactly the one-crab
shops the limit exists to protect — SUDSY would be at a 2-staff limit with one
employee.

### THE DIAL RUNS BACKWARDS, and that was a real bug

Every other dial asks for MORE as its number rises. The cap asks for more as
its number **falls**, and step 0 — no limit at all — is the smallest ask on the
board. The shared *"ties go to the smaller ask"* tie-break therefore has to run
the other way round for this one dial (`capAsk`). Before it did, a rival owner
indifferent between three limits quietly campaigned for the most punitive one
on the ballot every time: they wanted `2 STAFF` where `4 STAFF` was equally
good to them.

**Watch for this on any future dial**: the tie-break assumes bigger = more
demanding, and a dial that inverts that has to say so.

### The mutation that survived, and what it cost to fix

Four mutations, four scenarios — except the third. **Counting bodies instead of
employees passed every scenario in the file.** The rule was real, deliberate,
documented, and completely untested; only an assertion aimed straight at it
(`bizHeads(b) === bodies - 1` for every owner-run shop) catches it. Same lesson
as the beach ball and the rivalry arm, third time now: *a rule you did not
write an assertion for is a rule you are not testing, however carefully you
commented it.*

### Cost

The grid is now 4 mechs × 5 rates × 7 pots × 5 floors × 5 limits = **3500
platforms**, scored once an election. `allPlatforms()` prices the purse half
once per (mech, rate, bowls) and shares it across the 25 floor/limit
combinations, which is what keeps `buildBallot()` at **30ms**.

## PAYDAY (Matt, 2026-08-20) — "not making salary needs to be a real alternative to going bankrupt"

His words: *"probably via a choice mechanic at the critical moment, 'take out
loan to pay salary' kind of button."*

### It already happened. It just cost nothing and said nothing.

The settlement paid whoever the till could cover and logged a peril line for
the rest. No debt, no grievance, no choice, no mention on the report. Missing
payday was **free**, which is why it was not an alternative to anything.

### The mechanic: two bills, two kinds of debt

This is the whole idea, and everything else falls out of it:

- **RENT is owed to a landlord who evicts you.** That is the cliff, unchanged —
  the credit line draws for it and running out is bankruptcy.
- **WAGES are owed to crabs who can only quit.** Skipping them is survivable,
  and what it costs you is your crew.

So there is no bankruptcy for a missed payday. There is a debt you carry
(`p.owed`), a grievance that will not shed that night (`WAGE_CFG.MISSED = 0.6`,
so **two misses in a row clear LEAVE**), and a button on the report offering to
borrow the difference. **Not pressing it IS the alternative** — inaction is a
choice here, not a default you failed to dismiss.

### The one line that made it work

The wage loop ran BEFORE the rent, so payroll spent the till down to nothing
and the landlord's bill hit an empty drawer. **Paying your crew was itself a
way to get evicted**, and the player never got the choice because the money was
already gone — the first fixture showed exactly this: rent covered, wages
missed, bankrupt anyway.

    const rentReserve = Math.max(0, Math.round(totalRent()));

Rank the two bills the way the world ranks them: the landlord is paid first
because he evicts; the crew are paid out of what is left and carry the rest.
On any ordinary night the till clears both and the reserve does nothing.

### What it looks like (seed 909, rent covered and never a penny more)

    day 6   owed $23    still trading   CLAWDIA g0.60
    day 7   owed $69    still trading   CLAWDIA g1.20 REFUSES d8   PINCHY g0.60
    day 8   owed $92    still trading   PINCHY  g1.20 REFUSES d9
    day 10  owed $115   still trading   PINCHY  g1.30 REFUSES d11

A self-correcting rhythm falls out of it for free: a refusing crab is not owed
that day, so their grievance decays, so they come back — and get stiffed again.
The town survives and visibly rots, which is a death the player can see coming
and act on, unlike a settlement that simply ends the run.

### Balance: it costs about one day

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | 0/16, median 11 | 0/16, median **12** |
| growth A | 1/8, median 11 | 1/8, median 12 |
| growth B | 1/8, median 12 | 1/8, median 13 |

Survival COUNTS are unchanged; towns last about a day longer. That is the
honest price of making a missed payday survivable, and it is small because the
crew walking out kills the income that was keeping the town alive anyway.

### The bank is not a wish

The loan draws on the SAME line the rent uses, and that line is deliberately
short (~a night's bills). One missed payday is about $46 against a $90 limit,
so the button is a **bridge over one bad night** — a town four broke paydays
deep has a debt the bank will not touch, and then missing it really is the only
road left. `wageLoanWhy()` says which of the two it is.

### And a fixture lesson, third time this session

`simlib`'s **`runDays(N)` is ABSOLUTE** — it runs while `day <= N`. A second
`runDays(2)` after `runDays(5)` is a silent no-op that returns instantly. The
first three attempts at this fixture "proved" that missing payday did nothing,
and all three were measuring a loop that never ran. Now in CLAUDE.md, and
called out at the top of the payday scenarios.
